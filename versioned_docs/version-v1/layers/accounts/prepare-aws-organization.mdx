The Cold Start involves more manual steps than other layers. Read through the following steps and see [the detailed documentation](/layers/accounts/tutorials/legacy-account-map/) for edge cases.

In short, the steps are...

| Steps                     | Actions                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Install requirements      |                                     |
| Build Geodesic            | `make all`                          |
| Vendor components         | `atmos workflow vendor -f quickstart/foundation/baseline` |
| Configure root SuperAdmin | Click Ops                           |

:::tip Cold Start

The set up process for the "baseline" or "account" layer is commonly referred to as the Cold Start.

## Prerequisites

Follow the [prerequisites steps in the How-to Get Started guide](/layers/project/#0-prerequisites).

Start your Geodesic shell before continuing.


## Before Running Terraform (ClickOps)

First, you'll need to perform some ClickOps to ensure things are set up before we use Terraform to manage AWS accounts.

From the root account:

<Steps>
1. ### Get Business Class Support
   Enable [business support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_support.html) in
   the `root` account (in order to expedite requests to raise the AWS member account limits)
1. ### Set up MFA on Root Account
   Set up up the Virtual MFA device on the root account, following
   [the instructions in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root) for enabling a virtual MFA device for an AWS account root user. Save the MFA TOTP key in 1Password by using
   1Password's TOTP field and built-in screen scanner to scan the QR code presented on the web page.
1. ### Create the `SuperAdmin` IAM User
   [Create a `SuperAdmin` IAM User](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/). Do not enable "console
   login", do set up MFA, and then create a single Access key. Create an API Credential for the `SuperAdmin` credentials
   in 1Password and store the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Assigned MFA device ARN, and TOTP key. This is the user
   we will use until AWS Team Roles (`aws-team-roles` component) are provisioned.
1. ### Enable IAM Access for Billing
   For billing users, you need to enable IAM access. As the root user
   [open up the account settings for AWS Billing](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-east-1#/Account),
   then scroll to the section "IAM user and role access to Billing information" and enable it.
1. ### Enable Regions (Optional)
   The 17 original AWS regions are enabled by default. If you are using a region that is not enabled by default (such as Middle East/Bahrain), you need to take extra steps. For details, see [the detailed documentation](/layers/accounts/tutorials/legacy-account-map/)
1. ### Prepare for Account Quota Increase
   In order to deploy all accounts, you need to request an increase of the Account Quota from AWS support. This requires an AWS Organization to be created first, which we will create with Terraform in the [Deploy Accounts guide](/layers/accounts/deploy-accounts/#-prepare-account-deployment). This request can take a few days to process, so it's important to get it started early so that it doesn't become a blocker.

   At this time we don't need to request the increase, but we should be prepared to do so as soon as the AWS Organization is created.

</Steps>
