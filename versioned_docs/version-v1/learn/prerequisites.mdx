<Intro>
  Before provisioning infrastructure, make sure you have the necessary cloud access and that your local workstation has the required software installed.
</Intro>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Obtain Cloud Access

    If you're working within an existing organization, ensure you have sufficient access to the accounts you'll be managing.

    If you're provisioning the infrastructure from scratch, you'll need the AWS root account credentials as part of the bootstrapping process before AWS Single Sign-On is set up.

    <TaskList>
      - [ ] AWS SSO Access (talk to your AWS administrator)
      - [ ] Ensure you can log in to AWS. See
            [How to Use Leapp to Authenticate with AWS](/layers/identity/how-to-log-into-aws/) to get
            started.
    </TaskList>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Setup Your Workstation

    Prerequisites for your local host computer:
      <TaskList>
      - [ ] Docker installed (to run our tools)
      - [ ] Slack installed (to communicate with our team)
      - [ ] `make` installed, preferably GNU Make
      - [ ] `git` installed
      - [ ] [Leapp](/layers/identity/how-to-log-into-aws/) for authentication
    </TaskList>

        ### Homebrew Users

        We typically ship a `Brewfile` with a list of local dependencies. Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and use
        `brew bundle` to install dependencies from the `Brewfile`
        <Steps>
          1. First, make sure you’ve [cloned the `infrastructure` repository](/layers/project/create-repository) for your organization.
          2. Just run `brew bundle install` to install all localhost dependencies.
             Here's an example `Brewfile` we typically include in the infrastructure repository.

              ```shell
              brew "atmos"
              brew "coreutils"
              brew "pre-commit"
              brew "terraform-docs"
              brew "opentofu"
              brew "tflint"
              ```

          3. Next, you'll need docker set up. There are a variety of ways to do this. Review the [Docker for Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) installation guide for macOS.
        </Steps>

        ### Docker on Windows

        ##### Setting up containers on Windows

        <Steps>
          1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or install
            [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and configure it to use `docker` instead of `nerdctl`.
          1. If you picked Docker Desktop, follow [instructions on WSL setup](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/), otherwise
            follow [Rancher's setup docs](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/ui/preferences/wsl).
        </Steps>

        ##### Using Ubuntu on Windows

        <Steps>
          1. First, [setup WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and then configure WSL to use version
             `2` by default with this command: `wsl --set-default-version 2`
          1. [Install Ubuntu for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)
          1. [Install Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)
          1. Launch Ubuntu shell from Windows Terminal
          1. [Add user to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
          1. If you chose to use Rancher, just install `docker`. If you chose to use Docker Desktop, you'll need to go into
            settings and enable your Ubuntu distro. Once applied, you'll see `docker` available in your Ubuntu shell `PATH`.
        </Steps>

        ##### Running Geodesic on Windows

        <Steps>
          1. You'll need an editor that supports WSL2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and most JetBrains IDEs support
            WSL2 using remote development plugins.
          1. Clone this repo into your WSL2 environment
          1. Install `curl` and `build-essential` with `apt-get`
          1. Launch your editor's remote development mode and open the repo
          1. You should now be able to run `make all` and have it build the container and launch a shell inside it
        </Steps>
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

        #### Docker on Linux Systems

        You should be able to use `docker` as normal. Launch docker before running the `Makefile`.

        Linux users should run Docker in ["rootless"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) mode. In this mode, the Docker daemon runs as the host user (rather than as root) and files created by the root user in Geodesic are owned by the host user on the host. Not only does this configuration solve [this issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic/issues/594), but it provides much better system security overall.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Clone Infrastructure Repository

    The infrastructure is where you'll find all the code to provision the reference architecture. You'll need to clone this repository to your local workstation.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/$org/$repo.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Build the Geodesic Toolbox Container

    Geodesic is a toolbox container that provides an interactive and consistent environment for executing infrastructure commands, similar to a devcontainer. It includes essential tools like `terraform`, `atmos`, and AWS CLI.

    Build this container before provisioning infrastructure.

    ```shell
    make all
    ```

    This will build the container and launch a shell inside it. You can now start provisioning infrastructure.
