<Intro>
We’re excited to announce our new **Platform Advisory** service—now available to Cloud Posse customers. Private access to Cloud Posse engineers.
</Intro>

Many of our larger customers—especially in **fintech, health tech**—who operate in regulated industries have asked for a way to get **private, real-time access** to senior Cloud Posse engineers for their most critical projects.

These teams often run into scenarios where:

<FeatureList>
  - **Delays, mistakes, or failed migrations would cost big**
  - They need to **de-risk complex platform changes**
  - They want trusted guidance on **Cloud Posse architecture and components**—from the engineers who built it
</FeatureList>

**Platform Advisory** was designed specifically to address these needs.

## What is Platform Advisory?

Platform Advisory gives your team:

<FeatureList>
- **Private Slack Connect** → direct access to Cloud Posse’s staff-to-principal-level engineers
- **On-demand Zoom sessions** → architecture reviews, migration planning, compliance discussions, and more
- **Same-day response (4-hour SLA)** → for high-impact requests
- **10 hrs/month of Flexible Support included** → for bug fixes, upgrades, Atmos enhancements, new components, and integration work
</FeatureList>

It’s designed for teams running on **Cloud Posse’s reference architecture and open source components** who need priority access to expert guidance—especially when getting it wrong isn’t an option.

## Why we built this

As more of our customers adopt Cloud Posse architecture for **mission-critical platforms**, they’ve asked for a way to engage more deeply—especially for projects where **de-risking migrations and accelerating delivery** matters.

When the team is facing a complex migration, rolling out new environments, or making high-impact platform changes—**waiting days for answers isn’t good enough**.

Platform Advisory gives them **priority access** to engineers who:

<FeatureList>
  - Know Cloud Posse architecture inside and out
  - Understand their environments and goals
  - Can chart the best path forward quickly and safely
</FeatureList>
