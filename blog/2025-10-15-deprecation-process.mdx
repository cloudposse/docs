<Intro>
We've documented our formal process for deprecating and archiving components to ensure transparency and give our community adequate notice when repositories are being sunset.
</Intro>

Hello SweetOps!

As part of our commitment to maintaining [300+ open source projects](https://github.com/cloudposse/) across Terraform modules, [components](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components), and other tooling, we occasionally need to deprecate repositories that are no longer actively maintained or have been superseded by better alternatives.

## New Documentation

We've added comprehensive documentation outlining our [Deprecation and Archival Process](/community/contribute/our-github#deprecation-and-archival-process) to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible for everyone in our community.

The process includes:

- **Transparent Communication**: We announce deprecations via pull requests with clear timelines
- **Prominent Warnings**: Deprecation notices are added to READMEs using GitHub's warning admonitions
- **Pinned Issues**: Each deprecation gets a dedicated GitHub issue with migration guidance
- **Grace Period**: Typically 90+ days to allow for migration and questions
- **Archival**: Repositories are archived (not deleted) and remain publicly accessible

## Why This Matters

This structured approach ensures that:
- You have advance notice before any repository is archived
- Migration paths and alternatives are clearly documented
- Historical access to code is preserved
- The community can provide feedback during the deprecation period

## Our Commitment

As stated in our [GitHub documentation](/community/contribute/our-github), we commit to always provide free and public access to our Open Source repositories. Even when archived, repositories remain accessible for historical reference and continued use.
