We've documented our formal process for deprecating and archiving components to ensure transparency and give our community adequate notice when repositories are being sunset.

Hello SweetOps!

As part of our commitment to maintaining [300+ open source projects](https://github.com/cloudposse/) across Terraform modules, [components](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components), and other tooling, we occasionally need to deprecate repositories that are no longer actively maintained or have been superseded by better alternatives.

## What to Expect

We've added comprehensive documentation outlining our [Deprecation and Archival Process](/community/contribute/our-github#deprecation-and-archival-process) to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible for everyone in our community.

When we deprecate a repository, here's what you can expect:

1. **GitHub Issue Created**: A pinned issue with detailed explanation, timeline, and migration guidance
2. **README Warnings Added**: Prominent deprecation notices at the top of documentation
3. **Blog Post Published**: Announcement in our changelog/blog about the deprecation
4. **Pull Request Submitted**: All changes announced via PR for community visibility
5. **Grace Period**: Typically 90+ days for the community to migrate and ask questions
6. **Repository Archived**: After the grace period, repos are archived (not deleted) and remain publicly accessible
7. **Blog Post Updated**: Announcement updated to reflect the archival completion

## Why This Matters

This structured approach ensures that:
- You have advance notice before any repository is archived
- Migration paths and alternatives are clearly documented
- Historical access to code is preserved
- The community can provide feedback during the deprecation period

## Our Commitment

As stated in our [GitHub documentation](/community/contribute/our-github), we commit to always provide free and public access to our Open Source repositories. Even when archived, repositories remain accessible for historical reference and continued use.
