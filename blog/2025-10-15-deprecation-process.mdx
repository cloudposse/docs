<Intro>
We've documented our formal process for deprecating and archiving components to ensure transparency and give our community adequate notice when repositories are being sunset.
</Intro>

Hello SweetOps!

As part of our commitment to maintaining [300+ open source projects](https://github.com/cloudposse/) across Terraform modules, [components](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components), and other tooling, we occasionally need to deprecate repositories that are no longer actively maintained or have been superseded by better alternatives.

## What to Expect

We've added comprehensive documentation outlining our [Deprecation and Archival Process](/community/contribute/our-github#deprecation-and-archival-process) to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible for everyone in our community.

When we deprecate a repository, here's what you can expect:

1. **GitHub Issue Created**: A pinned issue with detailed explanation, timeline, and migration guidance
2. **README Warnings Added**: Prominent deprecation notices at the top of documentation
3. **Blog Post Published**: Announcement in our changelog/blog about the deprecation
4. **Pull Request Submitted**: All changes announced via PR for community visibility
5. **Grace Period**: Typically 90+ days for the community to migrate and ask questions
6. **Repository Archived**: After the grace period, repos are archived (not deleted) and remain publicly accessible
7. **Blog Post Updated**: Announcement updated to reflect the archival completion

## Why This Matters

This structured approach ensures that:
- You have advance notice before any repository is archived
- Migration paths and alternatives are clearly documented
- Historical access to code is preserved
- The community can provide feedback during the deprecation period

## Our Commitment

As stated in our [GitHub documentation](/community/contribute/our-github), we commit to always provide free and public access to our Open Source repositories. Even when archived, repositories remain accessible for historical reference and continued use.
