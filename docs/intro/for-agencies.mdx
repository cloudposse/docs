<Intro>
  As an agency, moving quickly and serving numerous customers efficiently is a constant challenge. You've likely standardized your application stack language and frameworkâ€”now it's time to standardize your infrastructure too.

By leveraging our reference architecture for AWS, you can focus more on solving your customers' problems and less on the details of the tooling itself. Customize it to your needs and develop common, reusable patterns across all your projects, scaling as necessary. With our component and module library, you won't need to worry about creating original Terraform code. Instead, you can immediately benefit from what's already built and supported by our community.
