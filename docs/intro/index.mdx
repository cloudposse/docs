<Intro>
Cloud Posse's reference architecture offers a unique, open-source approach to infrastructure, fostering a collaborative ecosystem with the industry's largest library of Terraform modules and a comprehensive framework using [Atmos](https://atmos.tools). Whether you're an experienced developer or a Terraform newbie, our tools and community are here to help you succeed without sacrificing customization.
</Intro>

Before you jump into the Cloud Posse reference architecture, let’s review what makes it tick. Cloud Posse has been helping companies—from scrappy startups to massive enterprises—win big with Terraform. But here’s the kicker: we do things differently. Everything is based on Open Source that your team owns and operates. We're not another enterprise platform you have to pay for. We’re a community that’s here to help you succeed.

Our goal? To create a collaborative ecosystem where everyone, regardless of the company, can work together on infrastructure, so we stop reinventing the wheel.

How do we make this magic happen? First, we built the industry's largest library of Terraform modules for AWS, Datadog, and Opsgenie. Then, we crafted reusable components to give you rock-solid ways to set up your infrastructure. Finally, we wrapped it all up in a neat framework called [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) that ties everything together.

## Solutions

Whether you’re a developer with years of experience, a Terraform newbie, or a seasoned Terraformer, there’s a way for you to grow with us and get exactly what you need without sacrificing customization.

Here's why our reference architecture will work you!

## Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is written for DevOps or platform engineering teams that want an opinionated way to build software platforms in the cloud.

If the below sounds like you, then SweetOps is what you’re looking for:

1. **You’re on AWS** (the majority of our modules are for AWS)
2. **You’re using Terraform** as your primary IaC tool (and not Cloud Formation)
3. **Your platform needs to be secure** and potentially requires passing compliance audits (PCI, SOC2, HIPAA, HITRUST, FedRAMP, etc.)
4. You don’t want to reinvent the wheel

With SweetOps you can implement the following complex architectural patterns with ease:

1. An AWS multi-account Landing Zone built on strong, well-established principles including Separation of Concerns and Principle of Least Privilege (POLP).
2. Multi-region, globally available application environments with disaster recovery capabilities.
3. Foundational AWS-focused security practices that make complex compliance audits a breeze.
4. Microservice architectures that are ready for massive scale running on Docker and Kubernetes.
5. Reusable service catalogs and components to promote reuse across an organization and accelerate adoption

## What are the alternatives?

SweetOps is similar to [Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/)’s Terragrunt + subscription plan, [the Terraspace framework](https://terraspace.cloud/), and [BinBash’s Leverage](https://leverage.binbash.com.ar/).

How does it differentiate from these solutions?

1. **It’s based 100% on Open Source**: SweetOps [is on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudposse) and is free to use with no strings attached under Apache 2.0.
2. **It’s comprehensive**: SweetOps is not only about Terraform. It provides patterns and conventions for building cloud-native platforms that are security-focused, Kubernetes or ECS-based, with comprehensive monitoring and incident management, and driven by continuous delivery.
3. **It’s community-focused**: SweetOps has [over 9500 users in Slack](https://sweetops.com/slack/), well-attended weekly [office hours](https://cloudposse.com/office-hours/), and a [budding community forum](https://ask.sweetops.com/).

## How is this documentation structured?

This documentation site breaks down SweetOps into the following sections to help you get up and running:

- [**Design Decisions**](/reference-architecture/fundamentals/design-decisions): Up-to-date context on the decisions for implementing well-built infrastructure
- [**Setup**](/reference-architecture/setup): show how to step up a specific layer or resource in easy-to-follow steps.
- [**How-To Guides**](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides): show how to solve specific problems with SweetOps via a series of easy-to-follow steps.
- [**Reference**](/reference-architecture/category/reference/): Informative materials on specific tools and patterns within SweetOps.
- [**Components**](/components): Details on our vast library of opinionated root modules
