<Intro>
  As an enterprise, your monumental success over time has likely come at the significant cost of technical debt. As infrastructure grew organically, it's systems became complex and brittle. Many of those who built it, may no longer be around to support it. Now it's time to bring order to this chaos, thinking about the long-term success of your organization.
</Intro>

By adopting this reference architecture for AWS and the framework it's built upon, you'll set your enterprise up for long-term success by leveraging proven methods to increase reusability and conventions that scale across teams and cloud infrastructures, whether public or private.

- Governance
- Security & Compliance
- Scalability

## Getting Started

<Steps>
1. ### Initiate a Proof of Concept (POC)
   - Set up the reference architecture within your AWS organization.
   - Deploy a simple application to understand the setup and capabilities.
   - Evaluate the fit and identify any customization needs.

2. ### Assess Current Infrastructure
   - Conduct an inventory of existing infrastructure.
   - Identify areas of technical debt and potential risks.
   - Map current infrastructure components to the reference architecture.

3. ### Plan the Adoption
   - Develop a roadmap for the transition.
   - Define key milestones and deliverables.
   - Establish governance and compliance frameworks aligned with the reference architecture.

4. ### Pilot Phase
   - Select a small, manageable project to pilot the framework.
   - Implement the reference architecture components and gather feedback.
   - Establish continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

5. ### Scale Implementation
   - Roll out the reference architecture across multiple projects.
   - Train teams on new processes and tools.
   - Iterate on the architecture and processes based on real-world usage.
