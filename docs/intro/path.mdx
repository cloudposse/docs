    Our Quickstart provides an end-to-end configuration of our AWS reference architecture customized to your needs and implemented by you at your own pace.

    You can start today, by following along with our [Quickstart documentation](/quickstart) to get a sense of what's involved. Then, as a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/cloudposse/sponsorships?tier_id=472843), you’ll get exclusive access to our weekly invite-only [Customer Workshops](/support) and priority support via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/discussions) as you need it.

    To get started, follow the steps below to begin your GitHub Sponsorship.

    <Steps>
      - Initiate a [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/cloudposse/sponsorships?tier_id=472843)
      - We’ll send you a form so you can share your [Design Decisions](/quickstart/kickoff/#-review-design-decisions)
      - Then schedule a [kick off call](/quickstart/kickoff/) to review them with you.
      - Receive tailored configurations in 2-3 business days after the kick off call.
    </Steps>
