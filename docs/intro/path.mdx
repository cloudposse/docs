<Intro>
  Ready to build with our reference architecture? Choose your path: **Quickstart** (you implement with our configs) or **Jumpstart** (we implement for you). Both include the complete reference architecture configurations—the critical piece that ties all our free tools together.
</Intro>

All of the documentation on this site corresponds to our [AWS Reference Architecture](https://cloudposse.com/services).

We give away all the tools for free—[Terraform modules](https://github.com/cloudposse), [components](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components), [Atmos](https://atmos.tools), and TONS more. But the system that ties it all together? That's what we sell. Our reference architecture funds the Open Source that powers your business.

:::tip How Commercial Open Source Works

At Cloud Posse, we give away **everything** except one critical piece: **the configuration**.

All our tools are free—[Terraform modules](https://github.com/cloudposse), [components](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components), [Atmos](https://atmos.tools), GitHub Actions, and more.

But the complete system that ties it all together? That's what we sell.

**Why this matters:** The documentation on this site describes our reference architecture, but **following it without the Quickstart or Jumpstart configurations is not a supported path**.

You'll encounter gaps and blockers (like needing Atmos stack configs that don't exist without our configurations).

This commercial model sustains the open source ecosystem your business depends on.

When you invest in Quickstart or Jumpstart, you're funding the continuous development of all the free tools you use.

    Our Quickstart provides the **complete end-to-end configuration** of our AWS reference architecture, [customized to your needs](/quickstart/kickoff/#-review-design-decisions) and implemented by you at your own pace.

    **What you get:** The Atmos stack configurations (`stacks/catalog/*.yaml`), component wiring, and architectural decisions that tie our free tools together. This is the missing piece you can't get from the docs alone.

    Browse our [Quickstart documentation](/quickstart) to preview what's involved before purchasing.

    **Ready to build?** Follow these steps:

    <Steps>
      - [Buy our "Quickstart"](https://cloudposse.com/pricing) to receive all the configurations.
      - We’ll send you a form so you can share your [Design Decisions](/quickstart/kickoff/#-review-design-decisions) with us.
      - Then schedule a [kick off call](/quickstart/kickoff/) to review them with you.
      - Receive tailored configurations in 2-3 business days after the kick off call.
    </Steps>
