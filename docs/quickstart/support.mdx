    ## <StepNumber/> Join Weekly Customer Workshops via Zoom

    Join our weekly [Customer Workshops](/reference-architecture/fundamentals/kick-off/#shared-customer-workshop) to get any of your questions answered. Customer Workshops are only available exclusively to our Quickstart sponsors and are held twice a week. If your company sponsors Cloud Posse, please reach out to be added to the recurring events.

    These are group sessions with multiple customers, similar in format to Office Hours.

    Join the [Shared Customer Workshops](/reference-architecture/fundamentals/kick-off/#shared-customer-workshop) and ask our team questions. Customer Workshops are only available to current and previous customers and are held twice weekly. You can still join and ask questions after your engagement has concluded! Please reach out to Cloud Posse PMs if you need to be added to the recurring events.
