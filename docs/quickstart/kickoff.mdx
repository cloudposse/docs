## Kickoff Meeting Agenda

The following is the agenda for our Kick off call with you. We'll schedule this call as soon as you've purchased a [Quickstart](/intro/path) and submitted your [Design Decisions](#-review-design-decisions).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Introductions

    Here we will review who is on the call, what their roles are, and identify our technical point of contact at Cloud Posse. We will also review the working timezones of the teams.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Project Overview

    After your kick off call with Cloud Posse and receiving the configurations customized to your design decisions, you will be ready to begin deploying your infrastructure starting with the [foundation](/layers/foundation). The Reference Architecture is a collection of best practices for building a secure, scalable, and highly available infrastructure on AWS. The Reference Architecture is constantly evolving as we learn from our customers and the community.

    You will deploy your infrastructure in _layers_. These layers are designed to manage collections of deliverables and will be a mix of generated content from a private reference, vendored Terraform from open source libraries, and any customization for your Organization. Because we are delivering an entire infrastructure repository, these initial PRs will be massive; a complete infrastructure set up requires dozens of components, each with Terraform modules, configuration, account setup, and documentation. You are absolutely welcome to follow along, but we do not intend for your team to be required to review these massive PRs. Cloud Posse internally reviews these PRs extensively to ensure that the final product works as intended.

    Before you begin provisioning any layer, we recommend watching the video that explains the problems we faced, so you'll be better equipped to understand the solution. These videos go into detail on the subject to explain the problems we faced, the tradeoffs we considered and then at a high level how we solved them.

## How to Succeed

Cloud Posse has noticed several patterns that lead to successful projects.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Come to Calls Prepared

    Review six pagers and documentation before our calls. This will help you to know what questions to ask. Coming unprepared will lead to a lot of questions and back-and-forth. This will slow down material resulting in less time for new material.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Take Initiative

    The most successful customers take initiative to make customizations to their Reference Architecture. This is a great way to make the Reference Architecture your own. It also helps to build a deeper understanding of the Reference Architecture and how it works.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Cameras On

    We recommend that all participants have their cameras on during our Zoom calls. This helps to build trust and rapport. It also helps to keep everyone engaged and focused. This also lets us gauge how everyone is understanding the material. If you are having trouble understanding something, please ask questions.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Ask Questions

    We encourage you to ask questions. We want to make sure that everyone understands the material. We also want to make sure that we are providing the right level of detail. Our meetings are intended to be interactive and encourage conversation. Please feel free to interject at any time if you have a question or a comment to add to the discussion.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Participate in our Slack Community

    We encourage you to participate in [our public Slack channels](https://cloudposse.com/slack). This is a great way to get help and to learn from others. We have a lot of customers who have been through the same process and can provide valuable insights. We also have a lot of Cloud Posse engineers who are available to help answer questions.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Attend Weekly Office Hours

    Our free weekly [Community Office Hours](#community-office-hours) are great opportunity to ask questions and get help.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Read our Documentation

    You can always find how-to guides, design decisions, and other helpful pages at [docs.cloudposse.com](/)

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Take the Next Step

    Don't wait! Keep the momentum going by taking the next step. If you have questions, ask them. If you need help, ask for it. We are here to help you succeed.

  </Step>
</Steps>
