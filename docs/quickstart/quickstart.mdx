<Intro>
  This documentation will guide you through the end-to-end configuration of our reference architecture for your AWS organization. You can customize everything to suit your needs and implement it at your own pace. Many have completed the process in under a week, and we provide [tons of options for support](/support) if you get stuck.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Get the Quickstart Configurations

    All of this documentation refers to the prebuilt configurations we provide as part of the **Quickstart Package**, which is how we fund our open-source efforts. This is optional. You are welcome to follow along with the documentation and implement your configurations from scratch, but the Quickstart Package **will save you a lot of time**.

    And guess what? It's just a one time fee.

    ## <StepNumber/> Prepare Your Design Decisions

    Design Decisions are how we customize the Quickstart Configurations to your needs. We'll send you a form to fill out with your requirements.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Schedule your Kickoff Call with Cloud Posse

    Once you've submitted your Design Decisions, we'll schedule a call to review them with you.

    This is an opportunity to review them with Cloud Posse, and ask any questions before you get started.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Start Building

    After the call, you'll receive all the configurations customized to your requirements in about a 2-3 days.

    You'll use these configurations together with our documentation to get started with your first project.
