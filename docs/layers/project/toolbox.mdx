<Intro>
Geodesic is a powerful Linux toolbox container designed to optimize DevOps workflows by providing essential dependencies for a DevOps toolchain, ensuring consistency and efficiency across development environments without additional software installation on your workstation. It can be extended and customized to fit specific needs by creating your own `Dockerfile` based on Geodesic, allowing you to add your favorite tools and share the container with your team for a unified working environment.
</Intro>

<Note>
  Geodesic is similar in principle to [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/). However, being a container itself, Geodesic can run anywhere containers are supportedâ€”whether on your local workstation, remotely inside clusters, or on bastion hosts. Additionally, you can use Geodesic as the base image for a devcontainer.

## Building the Toolbox Image

Build a Geodesic infrastructure container. This container that has all the tools like terraform and atmos for building infrastructure. It's built from the `Dockerfile` and there are some predefined targets defined in the `Makefile`, to make this easy. Customize this `Dockerfile` for your organization. Here's an example for reference.

The standard `Makefile` includes a number of commands. In order to build the initial, complete Geodesic image, run the following:

```bash
make all
```

On future builds, use `make run` to use the cached image.

:::tip Alias

We install a wrapper script with `make all` to your chosen namespace in the `Makefile`. For example, simply enter for given namespace to start your Geodesic container once built:

```bash
acme
```

See the `install` step of the `Makefile` for more details.

:::

Build the toolbox image locally before continuing.

Follow the [toolbox image setup steps in the How-to Get Started guide](/layers/project/#building-the-toolbox-image). In short,
run `make all`.

The container will have the given local home mapped, so you should be able to use aws normally inside it once you set a profile that has valid credentials. For instance, if I log in to the profile `acme` with [leapp](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp), I can run `aws --profile acme sts get-caller-identity` and get a response.

Once you've verified that the infra container has access to aws resources, we can move on to the next step.

  With your repository set up, workstation configured and toolbox in hand, you're ready to get to work provisioning your infrastructure with Atmos and Terraform. The next step is to learn how to provision AWS accounts.
