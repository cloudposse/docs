We highly recommend using a mono-repo for your foundational infrastructure. This doesnâ€™t preclude introducing other
infrastructure repositories in the future.

Suggestions:

- `infrastructure`
- `infra`
- `$namespace-infra` (e.g. `cpco-infra`)
- `cloud-infrastructure`
- `ops`
- `cloud-ops`

If you already have a repo by any of these names, we suggest you create a new one so we can start with a clean history.
