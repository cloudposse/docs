<Note title="Heads up!">
The older `compliance` and `compliance-root` components are deprecated as of July 2023. We recommend moving to our new
[`aws-config`](/components/library/aws/aws-config/), [`guardduty`](/components/library/aws/guardduty/), and
[`security-hub`](/components/library/aws/security-hub/) components.
</Note>

## Problem

We need to ensure your AWS Organization meets certain benchmarks for compliance (e.g. HIPAA, PCI/DSS, etc). Your AWS
accounts contain thousands of resources, making it impossible to audit without automation. Setting up the automation by
hand is tedious and error-prone.

## Solution

Deploy a set of Cloud Posse components to enable SecurityHub, GuardDuty, AWS Config, and more!

:::caution

It is very important that you read these docs and follow all of the steps carefully and in order. Failure to do so may
result in a condition that needs to be manually cleaned up across tens of regions in each of your accounts.

### Background Info

The AWS Config, Security Hub, and GuardDuty services must be configured in every enabled region in each of your AWS
accounts. Unfortunately, [AWS does not support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html)
disabling regions which were introduced prior to March 20, 2019. These regions are enabled by default. The table below
lists the regions that cannot be disabled.

:::info

In addition to the regions below, the AWS services listed above must also be deployed to any regions you opted into.

|                |                |           |           |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ap-northeast-1 | ap-southeast-2 | eu-west-2 | us-west-1 |
| ap-northeast-2 | ca-central-1   | eu-west-3 | us-west-2 |
| ap-northeast-3 | eu-central-1   | sa-east-1 |           |
| ap-south-1     | eu-north-1     | us-east-1 |           |
| ap-southeast-1 | eu-west-1      | us-east-2 |           |

The Cloud Posse AWS Config, Guard Duty, and Security Hub components (the "Components") are responsible for deploying
these AWS services in a sane way. At the AWS Organizational level, the Components designate an account to be the primary
account within the AWS Organization responsible for configuring the service. This is referred to as the Delegated
Administrator account. In addition, where possible, the Components designate a single region to be the “central
collection region” so that compliance information can be aggregated into a single region.

In a typical REFARCH setup, the logs are written to the `audit` account, the AWS services (Config, Security Hub, and
GuardDuty) are deployed to the `security` account, and the Organizational management account (`root` account) is used to
delegate `security` as the Delegated Administrator account. The central collection region is usually the same as the
primary region used in your platform accounts for hosting your application workloads.
