<Intro>
These are the setup instructions for Security and Compliance in your AWS Organization.
</Intro>

## Organization-Level Configuration

The following steps are required to set up Security and Compliance in your AWS Organization. They only be completed once for the entire organization.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Vendor Components

    Vendor all data components with the following workflow:

    ```bash
    atmos workflow vendor -f compliance
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Add Service Principals to the `account` component

    Add the following service principals to the `aws_service_access_principals` variable of the `account` in
    `stacks/catalog/account.yaml`:

    - `config.amazonaws.com`
    - `config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com`
    - `guardduty.amazonaws.com`
    - `securityhub.amazonaws.com`

    <Note title="Reminder">
      The following command requires [SuperAdmin](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/). Ensure the `plan` output only touches service principals.
    </Note>

    ```bash
    atmos terraform plan account -s core-gbl-root
    ```

    The output of `plan` should look similar to the following:

    ```1vRLXlhggjCF4VZ09qvOF9nLoxi__0EVFgDjgtfLlSRZfzPbd5ZhvzOLSVHECM015A7SCNPJoCeXPb3X
      # aws_organizations_organization.this[0] will be updated in-place
      ~ resource "aws_organizations_organization" "this" {
          ~ aws_service_access_principals = [
              + "config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com",
              + "config.amazonaws.com",
                # (8 unchanged elements hidden)
            ]
            id                            = "[random string]"
            # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)
        }

    Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```

    Apply the changes with:

    ```bash
    atmos terraform apply account -s core-gbl-root
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy `config-bucket`

    <Note title="Important">
    There should only be a single bucket that will act as a store for AWS Config data across all regions
    </Note>

    The `config-bucket` is required for storing `AWS Config` data and is a pre-requisite for deploying AWS Config. See
    [config-bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-config-storage)

    ```bash
    atmos terraform plan config-bucket --stack core-use1-audit
    atmos terraform apply config-bucket --stack core-use1-audit
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy `cloudtrail-bucket`

    <Note title="Important">
    There should only be a single bucket that will act as a store for AWS CloudTrail data across all regions
    </Note>

    Deploying the `cloudtrail-bucket` to the Audit account allows the Organization to isolate audit data and permissions
    from other environments (production, staging, development) and is a requirement for deploying Security Hub. See
    [cloudtrail-bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket)

    <Admonition type="info">
      This bucket has likely been provisioned by the [Cold Start](/layers/accounts/account-baseline/). Run the following `terraform plan` to ensure the bucket exists. If it doesn't, create it with `terraform apply`.
    </Admonition>

    ```bash
    atmos terraform plan cloudtrail-bucket --stack core-use1-audit
    atmos terraform apply cloudtrail-bucket --stack core-use1-audit
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy IAM Role for CIS Benchmark

    Part of the benchmark rules for CIS AWS Foundations includes deploying a support role to manage incidents with AWS
    Support. See
    [CIS Benchmark 1.20](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cis-controls.html#securityhub-cis-controls-1.20)
    and [IAM.18](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/iam-controls.html#iam-18).

    These roles are managed from the [Identity Workflow](/layers/identity/deploy/)
    using `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` components.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## AWS Config

:::info

If a step in one of the following workflows fails you can restart from that failed step by using the following command:

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/aws-config/global-collector -f compliance --from-step step4
```

:::
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Deploy AWS Config to each region in order to collect data for global resources such as IAM.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/aws-config/global-collector -f compliance
    ```

    <Note title="Reminder">
      This command requires [`SuperAdmin`](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Deploy AWS Config into accounts that require superadmin to apply.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/aws-config/superadmin -f compliance
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Hub

<Steps>
  <Step>
    First, deploy to each region of the Delegated Administrator account.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/security-hub/step1 -f compliance
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Next, using
    [SuperAdmin](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/),
    deploy to the Organization Management (root) account in order to designate the `security` account as the Organization
    Delegated Administrator account.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/security-hub/step2 -f compliance
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    `assume-role acme-identity`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Finally, deploy the `security-hub/org-settings` component to the `security` account in order to enable and configure
    Security Hub in all other accounts and regions.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/security-hub/step3 -f compliance
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Guard Duty

First, deploy to each region of the Delegated Administrator account.

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/guardduty/step1 -f compliance
```

Next, deploy to the Organization Management (root) account in order to designate the `security` account as the
Organization Delegated Administrator account.

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/guardduty/step2 -f compliance
```

Finally, deploy to the `security` account in order to enable and configure GuardDuty in all other accounts and regions.

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/guardduty/step3 -f compliance
```

## Route53 DNS Resolver Firewall

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/route53-resolver-dns-firewall-buckets -f compliance
atmos workflow deploy/route53-resolver-dns-firewall -f compliance
```

## AWS Shield

:::info

An [AWS Shield Advanced subscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-ddos-prem.html) is
required in each `plat` AWS account before running this workflow.

:::

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/aws-shield -f compliance
```

## AWS Inspector v2

Delegates Administration account for [AWS Inspector v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/what-is-inspector.html) to `core-security` for all regions.

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/aws-inspector2/step1 -f compliance
```

Enables Inspector in all regions across accounts

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/aws-inspector2/step2 -f compliance
```
