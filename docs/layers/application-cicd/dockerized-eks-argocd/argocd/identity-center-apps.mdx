# How to create an AWS Identity Center Application for ArgoCD

In order to authenticate with ArgoCD, we recommend using an AWS IAM Identity Center SAML Application. These apps can use existing Identity Center groups that we've already setup as part of the [Identity layer](/reference-architecture/setup/identity/).

## Create AWS Identity Center Applications

1. For each `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` in the `plat` tenant, create an [IAM Identity Center Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/samlapps.html).
2. Use the 'callback' url of `eks/argocd` for both the ACS URL and the SAML Audience fields. For example, `https://argocd.use1.dev.plat.acme-svc.com/api/dex/callback`. This should be your _service domain_.
3. Next, update the custom SAML application attributes:

| Name | Value           | Type        |
|:---------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `Subject`        | `${user:subject}` | `persistent`  |
| `email`          | `${user:email}`   | `unspecified` |
| `groups`         | `${user:groups}`  | `unspecified` |

4. Now assign AWS Identity Center groups to the SAML app. If you ever recreate the groups, you'll need to go back to the SAML application and remove/re-add the group.
5. Record the IDs of each group you assigned. If you've recently updated the groups, you'll likely need to redo this step as group IDs change on any significant updates.
6. Update the config for `eks/argocd` to use the given AWS Identity Center groups groups:

```console
components:
  terraform:
    eks/argocd:
      vars:
        # Note: the IDs for AWS Identity Center groups will change if you alter/replace them:
        argocd_rbac_groups:
          - group: deadbeef-dead-beef-dead-beefdeadbeef
            role: admin
          - group: aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
            role: reader
```

7. Finally, for each stage run `atmos terraform deploy sso-saml-provider -s plat-use1-{ stage }`

:::info Tip

If you get any errors using AWS SSO, make sure the `Subject` attribute is set to `persistent` and connect to the cluster with `set-cluster plat-{ region }-{ stage } admin && kubens argocd` and then delete the dex pod to reset it.
