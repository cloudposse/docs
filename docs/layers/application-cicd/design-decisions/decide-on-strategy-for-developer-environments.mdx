# Decide on Strategy for Developer Environments

## Versioning Considerations

- Use latest in the default branch?

- Use the latest release?

- Use any developer-specified release?

- How do overwrite it?

## Strategy Considerations

- Local

- Do your developer workstations/laptops have sufficient resources to build and launch all dependent services?

- Remote

- Hybrid

## Tool Considerations

1. Garden

2. Skaffold

3. Docker Compose
