# Decide on Repositories Strategy

## Context and Problem Statement

## Problem Statement
Deciding repository strategies for your codebase is a crucial choice because it can significantly
impact your development processes, collaboration effectiveness, tooling, and architectural decisions.
There are two main strategies for organizing source code repositories:
[monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) and `polyrepo`.
In a middle there can be a hybrid strategies:
* `multi monorepos`
* `monorepo as read-only proxy`
* `polyrepos & monorepos`

The hybrid strategies inherit gains and loss of the main two.
That's why focus on pros and const for the main repository structures.

## Poly repo

In a polyrepo structure, each project, service, or library has its own repository.

### Benefits

#### Isolation

Each project is isolated from others, reducing the risk of a change in one project inadvertently affecting others.

#### Scalability

Polyrepos can scale more effectively as each repository can be managed separately.

#### Simple and fast CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines contains less logic and works faster because it only has to process the relevant parts of the codebase.

### Challenges

#### Code Duplication

Code that's shared between projects might have to be duplicated in each repository.

#### Increased Management Overhead
Managing multiple repositories can be more complex and time-consuming.

#### Complex Dependency Management
If libraries have interdependencies, it can be harder to manage versioning across multiple repositories.


## Monorepo

Monorepos hold all of an organization's code in a single repository. All projects, libraries, and services
live together.

### Benefits

#### Code Sharing and Reuse

With all the code in one place, it's easy to share and reuse code across multiple projects.
This can lead to more consistent code, reduce duplication, and enhance productivity.

#### Unified Versioning
A monorepo has a single source of truth for the current state of the system.

#### Collaboration and Code Review
Developers can work together on code, have visibility of changes across the entire project, and
perform code reviews more effectively.

#### Simplified Dependency Management
All projects use the same version of third-party dependencies, which can make managing those dependencies easier.

### Challenges

#### Scalability
As a codebase grows, it can become more challenging to manage and navigate a monorepo.

#### Complex and slower CI/CD Pipelines
Continuous integration and deployment can become slower as your codebase grows because the pipeline
may need to compile and test the entire codebase for every change.
CI/CD pipelines for monorepo are complex and required special tooling such as
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/), [Please](https://please.build/) or [Buck](https://buck2.build/).

#### Risk of Breaking Changes
A small change in one part of the codebase might break something else unexpectedly since everything is interconnected.

#### Dummy Versioning
Whenever the entire monorepo is tagged, it automatically assigns this new tag to all code inside, including
all hosted libraries. This could lead to the release of all these libraries under the new version number,
even if many of these libraries have not been updated or modified in any way.


## Recommendation

We recommend using `Polyrepo` as a basic repository organization strategy because it leads to faster development cycle,
simplify CI/CD pipelines, do not require additional tooling.

Active usage of preview (ephemeral) and QA environments, testing automation,
deployment on multiple stages (dev -> staging -> prod) during release workflow and implementing of a particular deployment
patterns (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling) allow catching integration issues before the code goes on production.

The repository strategy does not have to be the same across the whole organization - different teams can
use different patterns, but that lead to the complexity of the CI/CD pipelines and reduce reusability.

That's why we recommend having a consistent repository strategy, at least on a team level.
