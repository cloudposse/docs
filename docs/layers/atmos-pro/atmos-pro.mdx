<Intro>
  Atmos Pro is our advanced GitOps solution for Terraform and OpenTofu automation, designed to provide enterprise-grade workflow orchestration in GitHub Actions. It extends the capabilities of standard GitHub Actions with powerful features for managing infrastructure deployments, ensuring compliance, and maintaining infrastructure as code at scale.
</Intro>

## The Problem

While GitHub Actions provides a solid foundation for CI/CD, it lacks the specialized tooling needed for complex infrastructure deployments. Teams face several challenges:

<Steps>
- **Limited Deployment Control**: GitHub Actions doesn't provide built-in mechanisms for ordered deployments or dependency management between infrastructure components
- **Poor Visibility**: Understanding the impact of changes across your infrastructure requires manual investigation
- **Insufficient Guardrails**: Basic GitHub Actions workflows don't enforce deployment policies or prevent dangerous operations
- **Drift Management**: Keeping infrastructure in sync with code requires additional tooling and manual processes
- **Multi-Cloud Complexity**: Managing deployments across different cloud providers adds another layer of complexity
</Steps>

Traditional Terraform Automation and Collaboration Software (TACOS) solutions like Terraform Cloud, Spacelift, or Env0 attempt to solve these problems but often come with significant costs and vendor lock-in.

## Our Solution

Atmos Pro enhances GitHub Actions with enterprise-grade features specifically designed for infrastructure deployment:

<Steps>
* **Ordered Deployments**: Ensure infrastructure components are deployed in the correct sequence based on their dependencies
* **Dependency Visualization**: Automatically generate and maintain dependency graphs for your infrastructure
* **Drift Detection**: Continuously monitor and report on infrastructure drift with automated remediation options
* **Enhanced Guardrails**: Implement policy controls and approval gates to prevent dangerous operations
* **Native GitOps**: Leverage Git as the single source of truth with full audit trails and change history
* **Beautiful Job Summaries**: Clear, actionable insights into deployment status and changes
</Steps>

## How It Works

Atmos Pro integrates seamlessly with your GitOps workflow, providing automated infrastructure planning and deployment through two main processes:

### Pull Request Workflow

When a developer creates a pull request, Atmos Pro automatically triggers the planning process:

<Steps>
1. **Developer Makes a Change**: Infrastructure code is modified in a feature branch
2. **Code Is Pushed**: Changes are pushed to the feature branch
3. **GitHub Actions Trigger**: Atmos affected stacks are identified
4. **Atmos Uploads**: Affected stacks information is uploaded
5. **Atmos Pro Dispatches**: Plan workflows are triggered for affected components
6. **Status Updates**: Atmos Pro maintains a status comment showing the progress of plans
</Steps>

### Merge Workflow

When a pull request is merged, Atmos Pro automatically handles the deployment:

<Steps>
1. **Pull Request Is Merged**: Changes are merged into the main branch
2. **GitHub Actions Trigger**: Atmos affected stacks are identified
3. **Atmos Uploads**: Affected stacks information is uploaded
4. **Atmos Pro Dispatches**: Apply workflows are triggered for affected components
5. **Status Updates**: Atmos Pro maintains a status comment showing the progress of deployments
</Steps>
