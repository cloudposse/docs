<Intro>
  Setting up Atmos Pro is straightforward: install the GitHub App, grant repository permissions, set up the workflows, and deploy the AWS infrastructure. This guide provides an overview of each step, with detailed instructions available in the linked pages.
</Intro>

## Setup Process

<KeyPoints title="Before You Begin">
  <TaskList>
    - Admin access to both GitHub and AWS
    - Familiarity with the detailed instructions in each linked guide
    - A small test change ready to validate the setup
  </TaskList>
</KeyPoints>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Sign up for Atmos Pro

    The first step is to sign up for Atmos Pro. The sign up process includes creating a workspace in the Atmos Pro web console and installing the Atmos Pro GitHub App into your infrastructure repository. This will set up the connection between your repository and Atmos Pro.

    <TaskList>
      - Sign up for Atmos Pro
      - Create or join a workspace
      - Install the Atmos Pro GitHub App
      - Import your repositories
    </TaskList>

    For step-by-step instructions, see the [official Atmos Pro installation guide](https://atmos-pro.com/docs/install).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Grant Repository Permissions

    Grant repository permissions in Atmos Pro to enable ordered deployments, drift detection, and other features.

    Navigate to your repository in the Atmos Pro dashboard, click **Quick Actions**, and select **Repository Permissions**. Add the following permissions:

    | Permission | Workflow | Branch | Environment |
    | :--------- | :------- | :----- | :---------- |
    | `Affected Stacks Create` | `*` | `*` | `*` |
    | `Instances Create` | `*` | `*` | `*` |
    | `Instances Update` | `*` | `*` | `*` |

    - **Affected Stacks Create** — Required for PR workflows to report affected stacks
    - **Instances Create** — Required for drift detection to register instances
    - **Instances Update** — Required for drift detection to update instance status

    For detailed instructions, see the [official Atmos Pro repository permissions guide](https://atmos-pro.com/docs/ordered-deployments/repository-permissions).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Set Up Workflows

    The third step is to configure the workflows in your repository. This includes reviewing the generated workflows, setting up environment variables, and configuring branch protection rules.

    <TaskList>
      - Review the 3 GitHub Action workflows
      - Add the Workspace ID to GitHub repository variables
      - Merge the workflows into the default branch
    </TaskList>

    _The dispatched workflows need to exist in the default branch before they can be triggered!_

    :::info
    These workflows are already included with the reference architecture. Review them to ensure they meet your requirements.
    :::

    The following workflows should be added to your repository:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="atmos-pro" label="atmos-pro.yaml">
        This workflow is triggered by GitHub on pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened) and when the PR is merged (closed). It uses the `atmos describe affected` command to identify affected components and upload them to Atmos Pro.

        <CollapsibleText type="medium">
          <CodeBlock language="yaml" title=".github/workflows/atmos-pro.yaml">
            {PartialAtmosPro}
          </CodeBlock>
        </CollapsibleText>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="atmos-pro-terraform-plan" label="atmos-pro-terraform-plan.yaml">
        This workflow is dispatched by Atmos Pro to create Terraform plans for affected components. It is a reusable workflow that takes stack and component as inputs.

        <CollapsibleText type="medium">
          <CodeBlock language="yaml" title=".github/workflows/atmos-pro-terraform-plan.yaml">
            {PartialAtmosProTerraformPlan}
          </CodeBlock>
        </CollapsibleText>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="atmos-pro-terraform-apply" label="atmos-pro-terraform-apply.yaml">
        This workflow is dispatched by Atmos Pro to apply Terraform changes for affected components. It is a reusable workflow that takes stack and component as inputs.

        <CollapsibleText type="medium">
          <CodeBlock language="yaml" title=".github/workflows/atmos-pro-terraform-apply.yaml">
            {PartialAtmosProTerraformApply}
          </CodeBlock>
        </CollapsibleText>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    For additional workflow setup instructions, see the [official Atmos Pro workflow configuration guide](https://atmos-pro.com/docs/ordered-deployments/github-workflow-config).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy AWS Infrastructure

    Atmos Pro doesn't run Terraform or Atmos itself. It dispatches GitHub Actions that **you control**. To run Terraform in those GitHub Actions, you need to set up a few things in your cloud environment:

    <TaskList>
    - [x] **State Backend** (S3 + DynamoDB) to store Terraform state and enable state locking
    - [x] **OIDC Integration** with GitHub for workflows to authenticate with your cloud provider
    - [ ] **Plan File Storage** (S3 + DynamoDB) to persist Terraform plan outputs for review and approvals
    </TaskList>

    <ActionCard title="Deploy with Atmos and Terraform (Recommended)">
      If you've been following along with the reference architecture, you should already have the Terraform State Backend provisioned. This guide walks through deploying the GitHub OIDC provider and IAM roles needed for GitHub Actions to authenticate with AWS.
      <PrimaryCTA to="/layers/atmos-pro/deploy-with-terraform">Deploy AWS Infrastructure</PrimaryCTA>
    </ActionCard>

    :::tip Alternative: CloudFormation

    All requirements can also be deployed with CloudFormation. This option is not included by default with the reference architecture but may be useful for organizations that prefer CloudFormation or need to bootstrap before Terraform is available.

    See [Deploy with CloudFormation](/layers/atmos-pro/tutorials/deploy-with-cloudformation) for details.

    :::

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

After completing all four steps, you can verify the setup by:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Test GitHub Integration

    - Create a new pull request with a small stack change
    - The Atmos Pro GitHub App will automatically comment on the PR
    - The comment will show the status of affected components
    - As workflows are dispatched for each component, the comment will automatically update
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Trigger a Plan

    - In the new pull request, change a value for any component. For example, add a tag to a S3 bucket.
    - The `atmos-pro.yaml` workflow will discover the newly affected stack and trigger Atmos Pro.
    - Atmos Pro will run Atmos Terraform Plan for the affected stack.
    - As the workflow is executed, Atmos Pro will update the comment on the PR with the plan status.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Merge the PR

    - Now try merging the PR
    - Again, the `atmos-pro.yaml` workflow will discover the affected stacks and trigger Atmos Pro.
    - This time Atmos Pro will determine this is a "merged" event and run Atmos Terraform Apply.
    - Finally, Atmos Pro will update the comment on the PR with the apply status.
  </Step>
