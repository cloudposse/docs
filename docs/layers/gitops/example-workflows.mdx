<Intro>
  Using GitHub Actions with Atmos and Terraform is fantastic because it gives you full control over the workflow. While we offer some opinionated implementations below, you are free to customize them entirely to suit your needs.
</Intro>

The following GitHub Workflows should be used as examples. These are created in a given Infrastructure repository and can be modified however best suites your needs. For example, the labels we've chosen for triggering or skipping workflows are noted here as "Conventions" but can be changed however you would prefer.

### Atmos Terraform Plan

:::info Conventions

Use the `no-plan` label on a Pull Request to skip this workflow.

:::

The Atmos Terraform Plan workflow is triggered for every affected component from the Atmos Describe Affected workflow. This workflow takes a matrix of components and stacks and creates a plan for each, using the [Atmos Terraform Plan composite action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan). For more on the Atmos Terraform Plan composite action, see [the official atmos.tools documentation](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-plan).

If an affected component is disabled with `terraform.settings.github.actions_enabled`, the component will show up as affected but all Terraform steps will be skipped. See [Enabling or disabling components](#enabling-or-disabling-components).

### Atmos Terraform Apply

:::info Conventions

1. Use the `auto-apply` label on Pull Request to apply all plans on merge
1. Use the `no-apply` label on a Pull Request to skip _all workflows_ on merge
1. If a Pull Request has neither label, run drift detection for only the affected components and stacks.

:::

The Atmos Terraform Apply workflow runs on merges into main. There are two different workflows that can be triggered based on the given labels.

If you attach the Apply label (typically `auto-apply`), this workflow will trigger the [Atmos Terraform Apply composite action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply) for every affected component in this Pull Request. For more on the Atmos Terraform Apply composite action, see [the official atmos.tools documentation](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-apply).

Alternatively, you can choose to merge the Pull Request _without_ labels. If the "apply" label and the "skip" label are not added, this workflow will trigger the [Atmos Drift Detection composite action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-detection) for only the affected components in this Pull Request. That action will create a GitHub Issue for every affected component that has unapplied changes.

### Atmos Terraform Drift Detection

:::info Max Opened Issues

Drift detection is configured to open a set number of Issues at a time. See `max-opened-issues` for the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-detection` composite action.

:::

The Atmos Terraform Drift Detection workflow runs on a schedule. This workflow will gather _every component in every stack_ and run the [Atmos Drift Detection composite action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-detection) for each.

For every stack and component included with drift detection, the workflow first triggers an Atmos Terraform Plan.

1. If there are changes, the workflow will then create or update a GitHub Issue for the given component and stack.
2. If there are no changes, the workflow will check if there's an existing Issue. If there's an existing issue, the workflow will then mark that Issue as resolved.

### Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation

:::info Conventions

Use the `apply` label to apply the plan for the given stack and component

:::

The Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation workflow is triggered from an open Github Issue when the remediation label is added to the Issue. This workflow will run the [Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation composite action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-remediation) for the given component and stack in the Issue. This composite action will apply Terraform using the [Atmos Terraform Apply composite action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply) and close out the Issue if the changes are applied successfully.

The `drift` and `remediated` labels are added to Issues by the composite action directly. The `drift` is added to all Issues created by Atmos Terraform Drift Detection. Remediation will only run on Issues that have this label. Whereas the `remediated` label is added to any Issue that has been resolved by Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation.

### Atmos Terraform Dispatch

The Atmos Terraform Dispatch workflow is optionally included and is not required for any other workflow. This workflow can be triggered by workflow dispatch, will take a single stack and single component as arguments, and will run Atmos Terraform workflows for planning and applying for only the given target.

This workflow includes a boolean option for both "Terraform Plan" and "Terraform Apply":

1. If only "Terraform Plan" is selected, the workflow will call the Atmos Terraform Plan Worker (`./.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-plan-matrix.yaml`) workflow to create a new planfile
1. If only "Terraform Apply" is selected, the workflow will call the Atmos Terraform Apply Worker (`./.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-apply-matrix.yaml`) for the given branch. This action will take the latest planfile for the given stack, component, and branch and apply it.
1. If both are selected, the workflow will run both actions. This means it will create a new planfile and then immediately apply it.
1. If neither are selected, the workflow does nothing.
