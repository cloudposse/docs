| 2. Vendor                       | `atmos workflow vendor -f gitops`                      |
| 3. Deploy                       | `atmos workflow deploy/gitops -f gitops`               |

## Requirements

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Self-Hosted Runners

    Although not required, we recommend first deploying Self-Hosted GitHub runners if you need to manage any resources inside of a VPC (e.g. RDS Users). For more information on setting up runners, see the [Philips Labs GitHub Runners](/layers/github-actions/philips-labs-github-runners) or the [GitHub Action Runner Controller (EKS)](/layers/github-actions/eks-github-actions-controller) setup documentation.

    If you do not wish to use Self Hosted runners, simply change the `runs-on` option for all included workflows in
    `.github/workflows`

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Set Up GitHub Variables

    The `gitops` stack config depends on the following GitHub variables:

    <dl>
      <dt>`ATMOS_VERSION`</dt>
      <dd>The version of Atmos to use</dd>
      <dt>`ATMOS_CONFIG_PATH`</dt>
      <dd>The path to the Atmos config file</dd>
    </dl>

    Please set the following GitHub variables in the repository settings:

    <Steps>
      1. Open the repository [settings](https://github.com/acme/infra-acme/settings/variables/actions)
      2. Set variable `ATMOS_VERSION` to the `1.63.0` value
      3. Set variable `ATMOS_CONFIG_PATH` to the `./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/` value
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Authentication Prerequisites

    The GitHub Action workflows expect both the `gitops` and `planners` AWS Teams to be properly setup and connected to GitHub OIDC. Both of
    these components should already be deployed with `aws-teams`/`aws-team-roles` and `github-oidc-provider` respectively,
    but `github-oidc-provider` will likely need to deployed to several additional accounts. Verify the following to complete
    the authentication prerequisites.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Trusted GitHub Repos">

    By default in the Reference Architecture, the `trusted_github_repos` input is commented out for `aws-teams`. Now is the time to uncomment those lines. Follows the tasks below. Please see `stacks/catalog/aws-teams.yaml`

    </Admonition>

    <TaskList>
      - The `gitops` and `planners` Teams are defined and deployed by `aws-teams`.
      - Both teams have trusted relationships with the infrastructure repo via `trusted_github_repos`.
        _Capitalization matters!_ In the reference architecture, these values are initially commented out and will need to be updated with your specific repository information:
          ```yaml
          components:
            terraform:
              aws-teams:
                vars:
                  trusted_github_repos:
                    gitops:
                      - "acme/infra:main"
                    planners:
                      - "acme/infra"
          ```
      - The `aws-team-roles` default catalog allows the `gitops` team to assume the `terraform` role, including anywhere
        `aws-team-roles` is overwritten (`plat-dev` and `plat-sandbox`)
      - Similarly, the `planners` team can assume the `planner` role in `aws-team-roles` to plan Terraform only.
      - `tfstate-backend` allows both teams to assume the default access role from the `core-identity` account
      - `github-oidc-provider` is deployed to every account that GitHub will be able to access. This should be every account
        except `root`.
      - The workflows have adequate permission
    </TaskList>

    <Admonition type="info" title="GitHub Workflow Permissions">

      In order to assume GitHub OIDC roles, a workflow needs the following:

      ```yaml
      permissions:
        id-token: write # This is required for requesting the JWT
        contents: read # This is required for actions/checkout
      ```

      In order to assume GitHub OIDC roles _and_ manage Github Issues, a workflow needs these permissions:

      ```yaml
      permissions:
        id-token: write # This is required for requesting the JWT
        contents: write # This is required for actions/checkout and updating Issues
        issues: write # This is required for creating and updating Issues
      ```

    </Admonition>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## How To Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Vendor Components

    The `gitops` stack config depends on two components that may already exist in your component library (`s3-bucket` and
    `dynamodb`) and adds one new component (`gitops`) to manage the GitHub OIDC access. Vendor these components either with
    the included Atmos Workflows or using [Atmos Vendoring](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/vendoring).

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="vendor" fileName="gitops" />
  </Step>

  <Step>

    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy GitOps Prerequisites

    Deploy the GitOps prerequisite components, `gitops/s3-bucket`, `gitops/dynamodb`, and `gitops` with the following workflow

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/gitops" fileName="gitops" />

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Reapply `aws-teams`

    Now we need to reapply `aws-teams` to add the trusted GitHub repositories to `gitops` and `planners`.

    Uncomment or add the `trusted_github_repos` input:

    ```yaml
    # stacks/catalog/aws-teams.yaml
    components:
      terraform:
        aws-teams:
          vars:
            trusted_github_repos:
              gitops:
                - "acme/infra:main"
              planners:
                - "acme/infra"
    ```

    Run the following command to apply:

    <Admonition type="info" title="Use a Privileged Role">

    `aws-teams` is a sensitive component deployed to the `core-identity` account and therefore needs to be applied with a role or user with access to the account. For example use the `managers` AWS Team or the SuperAdmin user.

    </Admonition>

    ```bash
    atmos terraform apply aws-teams -s core-gbl-identity
    ```

  </Step>
    And that's it! Now you can try creating a new pull request. If properly configured, you should see GitHub Actions kick off `Atmos Terraform Plan`.
</Steps>


<KeyPoints title="Tips">
  1. Enable GitHub Actions support for any component by enabling `settings.github.actions_enabled: true` and let the
    workflow handle the rest. Keep in mind this setting is likely enabled by default for your organization stack
    configuration, `stacks/catalog/acme/_defaults.yaml`
  1. The roles created by `aws-teams` or `gitops` should already be included in your workflows. Verify these roles match
    the `env` settings in `.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-*`
  1. You do not need to create a GitHub App or complete additional steps to trigger these workflows
