## Problem

As a new engineer joining the project, you are familiar with AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, etc, but you’re not
familiar with the opinionated way that Cloud Posse does it — what we call the _SweetOps_ method. There are so many
tools, conventions, components, stacks, that you don’t know where to get started.

## Solution

:::tip

Review the documentation, then start by getting your hands dirty with your first project. Don’t be afraid to reach out
and ask for help, if you get stuck. You’ll learn much faster this way and be less overwhelmed trying to master the
concepts that have taken us the better part of 7 years to develop.

:::

Here you will find a quick start document for each layer of infrastructure. These documents are intended to present a
common problem and a Cloud Posse solution to that problem.

Also included here are common tools for Cloud Posse as well as the library of
[**Design Decisions**](/reference-architecture/fundamentals/design-decisions) with context of every decision behind the
Reference Architecture.

# Checklist

:::info Documentation is our top priority

Please let us know if anything is missing or holding you up. We’ll make sure to prioritize it.

:::

This guide assumes you have the following:

- Terraform experience working with modules, providers, public registry, state backends, etc
- AWS experience including a firm understanding of IAM, SDK, web-based console, etc
- Existing AWS environment; See [Implement AWS Cold Start](/layers/accounts/tutorials/cold-start) for what Cloud
  Posse implements as part of our Foundational Infrastructure.

If this all sounds a little bit daunting, you may want to start by reviewing the [Learning Resources](/resources/legacy/learning-resources).
