# Getting Started

## Problem

As a new engineer joining the project, you are familiar with AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, etc, but you’re not
familiar with the opinionated way that Cloud Posse does it — what we call the _SweetOps_ method. There are so many
tools, conventions, components, stacks, that you don’t know where to get started.

## Solution

:::tip

Review the documentation, then start by getting your hands dirty with your first project. Don’t be afraid to
reach out and ask for help, if you get stuck. You’ll learn much faster this way and be less overwhelmed trying to master
the concepts that have taken us the better part of 7 years to develop.

:::

Here you will find a quick start document for each layer of infrastructure. These documents are intended to present a
common problem and a Cloud Posse solution to that problem.

Also included here are common tools for Cloud Posse as well as the library of
[**Design Decisions**](/reference-architecture/fundamentals/design-decisions) with context of every decision behind the
Reference Architecture.

## Introduction to Toolset

import ReactPlayer from "react-player";

## Checklist

:::info Documentation is our top priority

Please let us know if anything is missing or holding you up. We’ll make sure to prioritize it.

:::

This guide assumes you have the following:

- Terraform experience working with modules, providers, public registry, state backends, etc
- AWS experience including a firm understanding of IAM, SDK, web-based console, etc
- Existing AWS environment; See [Implement AWS Cold Start](/reference-architecture/setup/cold-start) for what Cloud
  Posse implements as part of our Foundational Infrastructure.

If this all sounds a little bit daunting, you may want to start by reviewing the
[Learning Resources](/reference-architecture/reference/learning-resources).

### 0. Prerequisites

Prerequisites for your local host computer:

- [ ] Docker installed (to run our tools)
- [ ] Slack installed (to communicate with our team)
- [ ] `make` installed, preferably GNU Make
- [ ] `git` installed
- [ ] [Leapp](/fundamentals/leapp) for authentication
- [ ] Infrastructure Git repo cloned

#### Homebrew Users

We typically ship a `Brewfile` with a list of local dependencies. Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and use
`brew bundle` to install dependencies from the `Brewfile`

1. First, make sure you’ve cloned the `infrastructure` repository for your organization.
2. Just run `brew bundle install` to install all localhost dependencies.

```
brew "asdf"
brew "gawk"
brew "coreutils"
brew "pre-commit"
brew "terraform-docs"
brew "tflint"

# Hedge against linuxbrew, `aws-vault` is a cask on MacOS
# but a regular formula in linuxbrew.
cask "aws-vault" if OS.mac?
brew "aws-vault" unless OS.mac?
```

Next, you'll need docker set up. There are a variety of ways to do this.

#### Docker on Unix Systems

You should be able to use `docker` as normal. Launch docker before running the Makefile.

:::info

Linux users should run Docker in ["rootless"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) mode. In this mode, the
Docker daemon runs as the host user (rather than as root) and files created by the root user in Geodesic are owned by
the host user on the host. Not only does this configuration solve
[this issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic/issues/594), but it provides much better system security overall.

:::

#### Docker on Windows

##### Setting up containers on Windows

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or install
   [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and configure it to use `docker` instead of `nerdctl`.
1. If you picked Docker Desktop, follow [instructions on WSL setup](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/), otherwise
   follow [Rancher's setup docs](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/ui/preferences/wsl).

##### Using Ubuntu on Windows

1. First, [setup WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and then configure WSL to use version
   2 by default with this command: `wsl --set-default-version 2`
1. [Install Ubuntu for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)
1. [Install Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)
1. Launch Ubuntu shell from Windows Terminal
1. [Add user to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
1. If you chose to use Rancher, just install `docker`. If you chose to use Docker Desktop, you'll need to go into
   settings and enable your Ubuntu distro. Once applied, you'll see `docker` available in your Ubuntu shell PATH.

##### Running Geodesic on Windows

1. You'll need an editor that supports WSL2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and most JetBrains IDEs support
   WSL2 using remote development plugins.
1. Clone this repo into your WSL2 environment
1. Install `curl` and `build-essential` with `apt-get`
1. Launch your editor's remote development mode and open the repo
1. You should now be able to run `make all` and have it build the container and launch a shell inside it

#### Building the Toolbox Image

Build the Geodesic infrastructure container. This is a container that has all the tools for building the app. It's built
from the `Dockerfile` using a `Makefile`.

The standard `Makefile` includes a number of commands. In order to build the initial, complete Geodesic image, run the
following:

```bash
make all
```

On future builds, use `make run` to use the cached image.

#### Cloud Access

- [ ] AWS SSO Access (talk to your AWS administrator)
- [ ] Ensure you can log in to AWS. See
      [How to Use Leapp to Authenticate with AWS](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/integrations/leapp) to get
      started.

### 1. Onboarding

After ensuring you’ve satisfied all the prerequisites, we recommend doing the following

- [ ] Join the Shared “Slack connect” channels with our team. These are usually named something like `#cloudposse-` on
      the customer’s side.
- [ ] Ensure you’ve been added to any calls with the Cloud Posse team. Depending on the type of engagement, you may have
      weekly cadance calls (Enterprise only) or weekly Customer Workshops (all customers). Cloud Posse PMs can help add
      members to the calendar event.
- [ ] Ensure you’ve been added to the <ins>Cloud Posse Jira Project</ins> for your company’s engagement with our team.
      Cloud Posse PMs can help add members. **Only applicable for Enterprise engagements**.
- [ ] Learn more about Cloud Posse because as a [DevOps Accelerator](https://cloudposse.com) we are very different from
      typical professional services companies.
- [ ] Review the different ways you can get [Support](/reference-architecture/support).

### 2. Learn the Cloud Posse Toolchain

- [ ] Read through the [Introduction to Toolset](#introduction-to-toolset) slides and become familiar with the concepts
      of [Components](/components), [Stacks](/fundamentals/stacks), and
      [Stack Catalogs](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs).
- [ ] Review [Geodesic](/fundamentals/geodesic) docker toolbox and
      [How to Customize the Geodesic Shell](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/tutorials/how-to-customize-the-geodesic-shell)
      to your liking.
- [ ] Review [Atmos](/fundamentals/atmos) CLI
- [ ] [How to use Atmos](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/tutorials/how-to-use-atmos)
- [ ] Review our [Conventions](/reference-architecture/reference/conventions) (there are a lot of them)
- [ ] Review [Fundamentals](/reference-architecture/fundamentals) and each core concept included as a subpage.
- [ ] Review the Architectural Design Records (ADRs) for your organization; these are typically in `docs/adr` within the
      infrastructure repository.
- [ ] Review Cloud Posse’s [Architectural Design Records (ADRs)](/reference-architecture/reference/adrs), which may not
      be the same as your organizations' practices
- [ ] Check out the [Learning Resources](/reference-architecture/reference/learning-resources) that have been curated
      from our weekly office hours

### 3. AWS Toolchain

- [ ] Review [Leapp](/fundamentals/leapp) and
      [How to Use Leapp to Authenticate with AWS](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/integrations/leapp)
- [ ] Review why we
      [Use Spacelift for GitOps with Terraform](/reference-architecture/reference/adrs/use-spacelift-for-gitops-with-terraform)

### 4. Kubernetes Toolchain

- [ ] [Helm](/reference-architecture/reference/helm)
- [ ] [Kubernetes](/reference-architecture/reference/kubernetes)
- [ ] [Lens](/reference-architecture/reference/lens)

### 5. Training Exercise

- [ ] Clone your company’s infrastructure repository
- [ ] Review the components in your company’s infrastructure repository (e.g. `infrastructure/components/terraform`)
- [ ] Review the stack configurations in your company’s infrastructure repository (e.g. `infrastructure/stacks/`)
- [ ] Review the catalog configurations in your company’s infrastructure repository (e.g.
      `infrastructure/stacks/catalog`)

### 6. How we Use Terraform (for developers)

- [ ] Review [Terraform](/fundamentals/terraform) conventions used by Cloud Posse
- [ ] We store all the terraform states in S3. Make sure you understand the
      [Structure of Terraform S3 State Backend Bucket](/reference-architecture/reference/structure-of-terraform-s3-state-backend-bucket)
- [ ] Learn
      [How to Use Terraform Remote State](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/tutorials/how-to-use-terraform-remote-state) -
      we make it really easy to read the state of any component in any account.
- [ ] Review [Component Development](reference-architecture/fundamentals/component-development/).
- [ ] [How to Switch Versions of Terraform](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/tutorials/how-to-switch-versions-of-terraform)
