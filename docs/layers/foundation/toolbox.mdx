## The Toolbox Image

Build the toolbox image locally before continuing. Follow the
[toolbox image setup steps in the How-to Get Started guide](/layers/foundation/#building-the-toolbox-image). In short,
run `make all`.

The container will have the given local home mapped, so you should be able to use aws normally inside it once you set a
profile that has valid credentials. For instance, if I log in to the profile `acme` with
[leapp](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp), I can run `aws --profile acme sts get-caller-identity` and get a response.

Once you've verified that the infra container has access to aws resources, we can move on to the next step.
