<Intro>
Geodesic is a powerful Linux toolbox container designed to optimize DevOps workflows by providing essential dependencies for a DevOps toolchain, ensuring consistency and efficiency across development environments without additional software installation on your workstation. It can be extended and customized to fit specific needs by creating your own `Dockerfile` based on Geodesic, allowing you to add your favorite tools and share the container with your team for a unified working environment.
</Intro>

<Note>
  Geodesic is similar in principle to [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/). However, being a container itself, Geodesic can run anywhere containers are supportedâ€”whether on your local workstation, remotely inside clusters, or on bastion hosts. Additionally, you can use Geodesic as the base image for a devcontainer.

## Building the Toolbox Image

Build the Geodesic infrastructure container. This is a container that has all the tools for building the app. It's built
from the `Dockerfile` using a `Makefile`.

The standard `Makefile` includes a number of commands. In order to build the initial, complete Geodesic image, run the
following:

```bash
make all
```

On future builds, use `make run` to use the cached image.

Build the toolbox image locally before continuing.

Follow the [toolbox image setup steps in the How-to Get Started guide](/layers/foundation/#building-the-toolbox-image). In short,
run `make all`.

The container will have the given local home mapped, so you should be able to use aws normally inside it once you set a profile that has valid credentials. For instance, if I log in to the profile `acme` with [leapp](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp), I can run `aws --profile acme sts get-caller-identity` and get a response.

Once you've verified that the infra container has access to aws resources, we can move on to the next step.

  With your repository set up, workstation configured and toolbox in hand, you're ready to get to work provisioning your infrastructure with Atmos and Terraform.
