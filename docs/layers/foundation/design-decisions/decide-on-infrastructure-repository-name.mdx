# Decide on Infrastructure Repository Name

We highly recommend using a mono-repo for your foundational infrastructure. This doesnâ€™t preclude introducing other
infrastructure repositories in the future.

Suggestions:

- `infrastructure`

- `infra`

- `$namespace-infra`

- e.g. `cpco-infra`

- `cloud-infrastructure`

- `ops`

- `cloud-ops`

If you already have a repo by any of these names, we suggest you create a new one so we can start with a clean history.
