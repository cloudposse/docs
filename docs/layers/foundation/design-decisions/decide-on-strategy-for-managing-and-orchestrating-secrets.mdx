# Decide on Strategy for Managing and Orchestrating Secrets

## Context and Problem Statement

Weâ€™ll inevitably need some way to store confidential key material and then access that from applications. Many options
exist, and the best option depends on the circumstance. An often overlooked piece of the puzzle is how the key material
will be created and updated, and how that ties into the broader release engineering workflow.

## Considerations

### Exfiltration

From a security perspective, we ideally want to avoid direct access to application-level secrets in the CI/CD pipeline.
This is achieved using two techniques: encrypted files or kubernetes operators and direct platform integration with the
secrets store. When not using Kubernetes the operator approach is not suitable.

### Secrets for Applications

- Secrets storage (e.g. SSM, ASM, Vault, Encrypt Files)

- Secrets retrieval

- Operators (e.g. external-secrets-operator)

- Application Code Changes

- Environment variables

- Secrets orchestration (CRUD)

## Considered Options for GitHub Actions

For all options, we assume secrets will be manually created and updated.

### Option A: GitHub Secrets

During the CI or CD pipeline execution, it may be necessary to have access to secrets. For example, integration tokens
with third-party vendors, or tokens to retrieve files (e.g. from VCS or S3).

- GitHub Secrets Environment variables

### Option B: AWS Secrets (SSM, ASM)

- GitHub Action reads from {SSM, ASM} storage leveraging GitHub OIDC to access secrets in AWS

- IAM Roles & Permissions for applications

- IAM Roles & permissions for teams

## Considered Options for ECS

### Option A: Use SSM

Natively supported by ECS. The `chamber` tool is convenient for updating values.

### Option B: Use ASM

Natively supported by ECS. ASM supports lambda hooks that can rotate secrets. Not as easy to manage on the command-line
as using `chamber.

### Option C: Use S3

Story secrets in a KMS encrypted file in a private S3 bucket. Fetch the file as part of the container entrypoint script.

This is only recommended if the number of secrets is so large we exceed the max document size of a container definition.
We have run into this when migrating highly parameterized applications.

## Considered Options for EKS

### Option 1: Use SSM + External Secrets Operator (Recommended for EKS)

:::tip

We recommend this option because SSM is a centralized source of truth and well understood.

#### Pros

- Applications automatically updated when SSM values change

- Easier to rotate secrets without CI/CD application deployments (a new `ReplicaSet` is created)

#### Cons

- es If many secrets change at around the same time, it can be disruptive to the application as each change causes
  kubernetes to create a new `ReplicaSet` as part of the Kubernetes `Deployment`

### Option 2: Use Sops Secrets Operator + KMS

#### Pros

- Easily rollout secrets along side application deployments

- Secrets are protected by KMS using IAM

#### Cons

- Secrets rotation requires application deployment

- Mozilla SOPS project (despite being used by thousands of projects) lack maintainers.
