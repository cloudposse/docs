<Intro>
Different versions of Terraform have different features and compatibility, but all 1.x versions are backward compatible. We need to decide on the best Terraform version to use to avoid issues and maintain consistency across modules and components.
</Intro>

## Problem

Historically, Terraform versions pre-1.x were notoriously backwards incompatible. This changed with Terraform 1.x releases and backwards
compatibility is assured for all subsequent 1.x releases. Our terraform modules and components strive to be on the latest version,
but with hundreds of modules and components, thereâ€™s sometimes a delay before we get the chance to _verify_ support.

## Considerations

:::tip

Cloud Posse recommends using the latest 1.x version of Terraform

:::

Prior to terraform 1.x, the version of terraform was a big deal due to backward compatibility issues between minor
releases.
