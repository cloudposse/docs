# Decide on Namespace Abbreviation

Using a common prefix for all resource names will help establish a consistent naming convention. Certain resources in
AWS are globally unique (e.g. for all customers). In order to maintain an (optimistically) unique naming convention,
prefixing all resources with a namespace goes a long way to ensuring uniqueness.

Shorter the better. Some AWS resource names like S3 bucket names and Elasticache Redis names are restricted to something
like 65 characters.

We recommend a namespace prefix of 2-4 characters. The longer, the more optimistic we can be about avoiding collisions
with other global resources in AWS.

Some strategies weâ€™ve seen is removing all vowels from your company name, or taking the initials for longer company
names.

Examples:

- Intel = `intl`

- Google = `ggl`

- Cloud Posse = `cpco`

:::note It is advised to keep the namespace as short as possible (< 5 chars) because of resources with low max character
limits [AWS Resources Limitations](/reference-architecture/reference/aws/aws-feature-requests-and-limitations)
