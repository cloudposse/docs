<Intro>
Learn how to create a GitHub repository to host infrastructure tools and configurations. Then configure repository settings, enable branch protection, and add collaborators.
</Intro>

Create an empty GitHub repository to host infrastructure tools and configuration, and clone it to your host computer
into a directory below your `$HOME` directory in the directory tree, for example,`/Users/user/src/infrastructure`.

## Setup basic repository settings

We recommend the following GitHub repository settings.

1. Under "Features", ensure "Issues" are enabled. We will use Issues with Atmos GitHub Actions for Terraform.
1. Under "Pull Requests", disable both "Allow merge commits" and "Allow rebase merging". We do this to create a clean
   commit history. Otherwise, the git history on the main branch will contain individual commits from each feature
   branch, which will result in a history which may contain _"dirty"_ commits.
1. Under "Pull Requests", check "Always suggest updating pull request branches"
1. Under "Pull Requests", check "Automatically delete head branches"

## Enable branch protection

1. Under branches, select "Add branch ruleset"
1. Name this ruleset whatever you'd like. For example, "Protected Branches"
1. Under "Bypass list", add your admin team. This team is able to skip the rules were are about to add, so this the
   bypass list should be sparingly granted
1. Under "Target branches", select "Add target" and "Include all default branches"
1. Then check the following rules:

- [x] Restrict deletions
- [x] Require a pull request before merging
- [x] Block force pushes

## Add collaborators and teams

Now add in your collaborators and teams. Under "Collaborators and teams", click "Add Teams". Generally most teams should
have "Write" access, and "Admin" access should be granted sparingly.

For engagements with Cloud Posse, please grant Cloud Posse "Write" access.

## Import the Reference Architecture

With the GitHub repository prepared, we are now ready to import the Cloud Posse reference architecture. Reach out to
Cloud Posse for details!
