<Intro>
  The AWS SAML component allows you to authenticate with AWS via a federated identity. This is an alternative to using AWS SSO, that provides lower-level control over the authentication process and supports multiple concurrent IdPs, but with more complexity and a reduced user experience.
</Intro>

As an alternative to AWS SSO, the AWS SAML creates an Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate with AWS via a federated
identity. You can use this federated identity to connect directly to a given AWS Team.

## Setting up IdP Metadata for SAML

<Steps>
  - ### Export an Identity Provider (IdP) metadata file from the chosen provider.
    You'll need to place this file inside the
  `aws-saml` component directory (`components/terraform/aws-saml/`) and commit this to version control. The filename
  should match the variable configured in `stacks/catalog/aws-saml.yaml`.
</Steps>

The creation of metadata files will be different for each IdP. Here are some example setup references:
