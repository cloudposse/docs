Frequently asked questions about identity and authentication with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.
</Intro>

## How do I create new teams?

Follow the docs in the readme of the [`aws-teams` component](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-teams).

## How do I set up Leapp?

See [How to Log into AWS](/layers/identity/how-to-log-into-aws/)

## Known Leapp Limitation with Windows and WSL

Leapp sets AWS credentials to the home directory wherever it is running. So if you run Leapp on Windows, that will be
set to the Windows home directory. Then when you start WSL2, that will have a different home directory. The workaround
is to copy AWS credentials from the Windows home directory over to the WSL2 home directory.
[ref](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/issues/153)

```bash
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/<username>/.aws ~/.aws
```

## How can I set varying permission for a role in several accounts?

Keep in mind that Team Roles are designed to identical in all delegated accounts. However, you can still modify
permission on an account-by-account basis if required.

Override your [`aws-team-roles` component](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-team-roles) stack configuration to include different permissions when deployed to a given account.

## Why not use AWS Control Tower?

AWS Control Tower until recently, did not support Terraform. Additionally, using Terraform, we have complete control over the Organization,
Organizational Unit, and Account provisioning process.

## Why not just use AWS SSO?

The primary reason to not rely solely on AWS SSO, is that cross-account terraform is not supported with AWS SSO Permission Sets. We cannot apply
Terraform across the account hierarchy with a single Permission Set, so instead we combine AWS SSO with our AWS Teams
and Team Roles.

AWS SSO is fine for business users but less so for DevOps teams.
