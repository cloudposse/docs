# Deploy AWS Teams and Team Roles across your AWS Organization

| Steps                         |                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Install requirements          |                                             |
| Vendor components             | `atmos workflow vendor -f identity`         |
| Prepare AWS SSO               | Click Ops                                   |
| Add your SAML provider        | Click Ops                                   |
| Deploy identity components    | `atmos workflow deploy/all -f identity`     |
| Reconfigure Terraform Backend | `atmos workflow deploy/tfstate -f baseline` |
| Deploy baseline components    | `atmos workflow deploy -f baseline`         |

The identity components are designed to provision all primary user and system roles into a centralized identity account.
These components are expected to be used together to provide fine-grained role delegation across the account hierarchy.

Deploy these components across all accounts by running the following command. Note that if any users or groups are
missing, `aws-sso` will fail.

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/all -f identity
```

Once the roles are deployed, the Terraform State Backend should be reconfigured to use the newly provisioned roles.
Apply those changes to Terraform State Backend by running the following:

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/tfstate -f baseline
```

## Generate AWS Config

Once the identity components have been deployed, we will need to create local AWS configuration for these new roles and
profiles. Generate those files now by running the following command from within Geodesic.

```bash
atmos workflow update-aws-config -f identity
```

This will generate AWS configuration to the `rootfs` directory locally. In order to apply these updates to your Geodesic
image, exit the image and rerun `make all`.

One of these configuration files will be named `aws-config-teams`. This file holds local configuration for all local
user authentication to AWS. This file will be the same for both SAML and SSO users, as well as for all teams. This file
looks for a specific AWS profile for your namespace, for example `acme-identity `, and uses that profile as the
entry-point for all role assumption. From this profile, all users with proper permission will be able to execute
Terraform or assume other roles across the AWS Organization.

:::info

Anytime that teams or roles are changed, rebuild AWS config

```bash
atmos workflow update-aws-config -f identity
```
