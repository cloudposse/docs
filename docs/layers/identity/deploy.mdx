<Intro>
  Learn how to provision AWS teams and team roles across an AWS Organization using Atmos workflows, integrate them with AWS SSO, and generate AWS configuration files for role assumption with profiles.
</Intro>

| Steps                         |                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Install requirements          |                                             |
| Vendor components             | `atmos workflow vendor -f identity`         |
| Prepare AWS SSO               | Click Ops                                   |
| Add your SAML provider        | Click Ops                                   |
| Deploy identity components    | `atmos workflow deploy/all -f identity`     |
| Reconfigure Terraform Backend | `atmos workflow deploy/tfstate -f baseline` |
| Deploy baseline components    | `atmos workflow deploy -f baseline`         |

The identity components are designed to provision all primary user and system roles into a centralized identity account.
These components are expected to be used together to provide fine-grained role delegation across the account hierarchy.

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy Identity Components
    Deploy these components across all accounts by running the following command. Note that if any users or groups are
    missing, `aws-sso` will fail.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/all -f identity
    ```

    <Note title="Important">Once the roles are deployed, the Terraform State Backend should be reconfigured to use the newly provisioned roles.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Reconfigure Terraform State Backend
    Apply the changes from the previous step to the Terraform State Backend by running the following. This will grant permission for your newly deployed AWS Teams and Team Roles to access the Terraform State Backend.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow deploy/tfstate -f baseline
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/>  Generate AWS Config

    Once the identity components have been deployed, we will need to create local AWS configuration for these new roles and
    profiles. Generate those files now by running the following command from within Geodesic.

    ```bash
    atmos workflow update-aws-config -f identity
    ```

    This will generate AWS configuration to the `rootfs` directory locally.

    <Note title="Important">
    The script that generates AWS config requires local files that are created when the AWS Team and Team Roles components are deployed.

    If you did not run these steps yourself and they are not committed to git, then you will need to rerun those components to generate these local files. For this reason, we recommend committing these generated files to git so that they are available for future use.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Apply Changes to Geodesic

    In order to apply these updates to your Geodesic
    image, exit the image and rerun `make all`.

    One of these configuration files will be named `aws-config-teams`. This file holds local configuration for all local
    user authentication to AWS. This file will be the same for both SAML and SSO users, as well as for all teams. This file
    looks for a specific AWS profile for your namespace, for example `acme-identity `, and uses that profile as the
    entry-point for all role assumption. From this profile, all users with proper permission will be able to execute
    Terraform or assume other roles across the AWS Organization.

    <Note title="Important">
    Anytime that teams or roles are changed, rebuild AWS config

    ```bash
    atmos workflow update-aws-config -f identity
    ```
    </Note>
