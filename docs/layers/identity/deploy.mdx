<Intro>
  Learn how to provision AWS teams and team roles across an AWS Organization using Atmos workflows, integrate them with AWS SSO, and generate AWS configuration files for role assumption with profiles.
</Intro>

| Steps                         |                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Install requirements          |                                             |
| Vendor components             | `atmos workflow vendor -f identity`         |
| [Setup Identity Center](/layers/identity/aws-sso/) | Click Ops |
| Add your SAML provider        | Click Ops                                   |
| Deploy identity components    | `atmos workflow deploy/all -f identity`     |
| Reconfigure Terraform Backend | `atmos workflow deploy/tfstate -f baseline` |
| Deploy baseline components    | `atmos workflow deploy -f baseline`         |

The identity components are designed to provision all primary user and system roles into a centralized identity account.
These components are expected to be used together to provide fine-grained role delegation across the account hierarchy.

<Note title="Important">
  All identity components in this guide required elevated permissions to deploy, and in particular require Administrator access in `core-root` and `core-identity`. Assume the SuperAdmin IAM user role before continuing.

  For more on SuperAdmin, see [How to Create SuperAdmin user](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/).
</Note>

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Vendor Identity Components

    Pull the Identity components into your local repository.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="vendor" fileName="identity" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Setup Identity Center

    Follow the [Setup Identity Center](/layers/identity/aws-sso/) guide to enable AWS IAM Identity Center and connect your IdP.
  </Step>


  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy Identity Components
    Deploy these components across all accounts by running the following command. Note that if any users or groups are
    missing, `aws-sso` will fail.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/all" fileName="identity" />

    <Note title="Important">Once the roles are deployed, the Terraform State Backend should be reconfigured to use the newly provisioned roles.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Reconfigure Terraform State Backend
    Apply the changes from the previous step to the Terraform State Backend by running the following commands. This will grant permission for your newly deployed AWS Teams and Team Roles to access the Terraform State Backend.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/tfstate" fileName="baseline" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/>  Generate AWS Config

    Once the identity components have been deployed, we will need to create local AWS configuration for these new roles and
    profiles. Generate those files now by running the following command from within Geodesic.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="update-aws-config" fileName="identity" />

    This will generate AWS configuration to the `rootfs` directory locally. Everything included in the `rootfs` directory is passed to the Geodesic image when it is built. This will include the AWS configuration files, included with the `aws-config-teams` file, that are needed to assume roles across the AWS Organization. In particular, we recommend setting a common AWS profile, such as `acme-identity`, as the entry-point for all role assumption. That way all users can configure the same AWS profile name and be allowed to assume roles that they can access.

    <Note title="Important">
      The AWS config script requires local files, which are generated during the deployment of the AWS Team and Team Roles components.

      If you did not run these steps yourself and they are not committed to git, then you will need to rerun those components to generate these local files. For this reason, we recommend committing these generated files to git so that they are available for future use.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Apply Changes to Geodesic

    In order to apply these updates to your Geodesic
    image, exit the image and rerun `make all`.

    One of these configuration files will be named `aws-config-teams`. This file holds local configuration for all local
    user authentication to AWS. This file will be the same for both SAML and SSO users, as well as for all teams. This file
    looks for a specific AWS profile for your namespace, for example `acme-identity `, and uses that profile as the
    entry-point for all role assumption. From this profile, all users with proper permission will be able to execute
    Terraform or assume other roles across the AWS Organization.

    <Note title="Important">
    Anytime that teams or roles are changed, rebuild AWS config
    </Note>

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="update-aws-config" fileName="identity" />
