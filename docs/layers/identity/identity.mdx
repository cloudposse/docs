# Identity and Authentication

There are several methods available to sign in to AWS through a browser or terminal, such as AWS SAML or IAM Identity
Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On). Various tooling has been tried to support AWS SAML, like "saml2aws," and
others to support AWS SSO, such as "aws sso login" and "aws configure," to manage terminal access. However, these tools
often had issues, such as not handling all methods of login with different IdPs and using screenscraping, which caused
anti-bot measures to block them, for example, Google Workspaces.

Cloud Posse's approach involves using IAM roles that provide highly precise control to different user groups. These
groups are assigned to users through AWS SAML Apps or AWS SSO Groups ("Groups") and enable the user to assume roles into
any allowed accounts. A significant advantage of this approach is the availability of an easy-to-use tool that works
with all AWS sign-in methods. In the following pages, the Cloud Posse strategy will be explained in detail,
demonstrating how it can be used to establish fine-grained access control for an entire organization.

## The Problem

One problem that many organizations face is choosing whether to use **AWS SAML** or **AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)**.

### The Problem with Pure IAM Identity Center Permission Sets

While **IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)** seems like a best fit for managing a single pane of
glass of users and their groups, often the downsides are not caught until later. Downsides such as the inability to
easily switch accounts and difficulty with tooling to ensure a consistent login for different groups while managing an
AWS configuration file for all these different groups.

This presents a major problem in Terraform, where we need to be able to access the state bucket in the root account,
then deploy resources to any given AWS Account. AWS SSO Permission Sets does not grant multi account access and would
therefor not support any complex Terraform.

### The Problem with Pure AWS SAML Team Access Roles

**AWS SAML** on the other hand does not provide a central place for managing users, groups, and permissions. But AWS
SAML does provide an easier login experience via the terminal and allows for multiple Identity Providers (IdP). Users
and groups are managed by the IdP, while permissions are managed with AWS Teams and Team Roles with Terraform.

### The Problem with Tooling

Tooling is another issue that plagues the AWS login experience. Switching roles in the UI can be solved via a Google
Chrome plugin called [extend-roles](https://github.com/tilfinltd/aws-extend-switch-roles), but that requires using
Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge (or plug-in compatible browser like Opera) as a web browser.
[Leapp](https://www.leapp.cloud/) is a great tool for logging in, but can be a bit clumsy for switching roles.

Another common issue is granting the proper permission for a user to sign into any account. AWS SAML signs into a single
role in the Identity account, and that Identity role should have access to roles in other accounts. On the other hand,
AWS IAM Identity Center grants a Permission Set for each account requiring the user to sign out and sign in to switch
accounts.

## Our Solution

**Our goals: team oriented, highly accessible, easily configured**

Taking into account all the challenges of using AWS SSO and SAML, let's summarize our requirements:

- We need the ability to use AWS SAML or AWS IAM Identity Center
- We need a single tool to manage logins to the AWS Console and CLI
- We need the ability to switch roles into other accounts easily, with team and account specific permissions.
- We need to be able to concurrently assume roles into multiple accounts (E.g. with Terraform)

### Team Oriented: Multiple AWS Accounts, One Team, with Exact Permissions

We introduce the concept of a **_Team_**. This Team is a group of users with access to a given set of accounts with
varying permissions. If using AWS SSO, our convention is to use a one-to-one mapping with a User Group, but this is not
required.

Every group of users has an identity Team, which the user immediately logs into. This is the purpose of the `identity`
account. From there, the user has the ability to assume roles, which permit the user to "sign-in" to the different AWS
accounts that the team has access.

We introduce the idea of a **_Team Role_**. This is a role in a given account (like `plat-dev`) that a Team is able to
assume from a Team. Team Roles provide standardized permission for all accounts. These roles are identical in all
accounts, but the only difference is which Team is able to assume the Team Role in that account.

For example, the `developers` team might have access to assume the `admin` Team Role in the `plat-sandbox` account but
only access to assume the `observer` role in the `plat-prod` account.

### Highly Accessible: No more chrome plugins, no more bash scripts

Now that we have the roles created with Teams and Team Roles, lets put it to work.

We need a tool that solves many problems listed above while being Multi-OS compatible and ideally programmable. We have
tried several tools, the one that works very well and appears to be gaining exponential traction is
[Leapp](https://www.leapp.cloud/).

Leapp is a Desktop Application (and has a CLI) that manages your active sessions for your AWS Config. This means it
handles logging in, and assigning those credentials generated to a given AWS profile.

Before continuing on all the problems Leapp solves, we need to state that the AWS Configuration file (`~/.aws/config`)
is usually highly dependent on your sign-in method. Different sign-in methods use different profile configurations. The
beauty of using Leapp is we can have a single config file regardless of your sign-in method. I will discuss this in the
next section.

So Leapp manages our credentials. It does so in a couple beautiful ways.

1. It works with any Identity Provider, and since it's an Electron application, it can prompt for sign-in, in the app or
   in the browser of choice.
2. It automatically refreshes your AWS credentials before they expire (No mid-terraform apply failures from expired
   credentials)
3. If we are using AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) it will sync the available `PermissionSets` from your login as
   available sessions.
4. It's Open Source

Since we auto-generate an AWS Configuration file and Leapp can use a CLI to create Sessions that manage Profile
credentials, we can set up automated AWS access for AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS SAML.

### Easily Configured: Identity Provider independent Configuration and Sign-in.

AWS Configuration files usually differ from AWS IAM Identity Center to AWS SAML. With Leapp however, we can use the same
configuration file and use Chained Roles in Leapp. **Chained Roles** in Leapp assume another role by configuration with
a single user action. For AWS IAM Identity Center this means we can create a Chained Role from our AWS IAM Identity
Center Permission Sets to our Team Entry Point. In regard to **Teams** this means that we can create a Chained Role
session for our **Team Roles** to access `dev` or `prod`.

## FAQ

### How do I create new teams?

Follow the docs in the readme of the `aws-team` component.
[`aws-teams` component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/master/modules/aws-teams)

### How do I set up Leapp?

See ["Setting Up Access"](#setting-up-access) above.

### Known Leapp Limitation with Windows and WSL

Leapp sets AWS credentials to the home directory wherever it is running. So if you run Leapp on Windows, that will be
set to the Windows home directory. Then when you start WSL2, that will have a different home directory. The workaround
is to copy AWS credentials from the Windows home directory over to the WSL2 home directory.

```bash
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/<username>/.aws ~/.aws
```

### How can I set varying permission for a role in several accounts?

Keep in mind that Team Roles are designed to identical in all delegated accounts. However, you can still modify
permission on an account-by-account basis if required.

Override your
[`aws-team-roles` component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/master/modules/aws-team-roles)
stack configuration to include different permissions when deployed to a given account.

### Why not use AWS Control Tower?

AWS Control Tower does not support Terraform. Using Terraform, we have complete control over the Organization,
Organizational Unit, and Account provisioning process.

### Why not just use AWS SSO?

The primary reason is that cross-account terraform is not supported with AWS SSO Permission Sets. We cannot apply
Terraform across the account hierarchy with a single Permission Set, so instead we combine AWS SSO with our AWS Teams
and Team Roles.

AWS SSO is fine for business users but less so for DevOps teams.
