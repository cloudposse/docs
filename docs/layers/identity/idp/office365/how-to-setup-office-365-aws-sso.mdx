## Problem

Office 365 is a common business suite that has an active directory to manage users and permissions. We need to utilize this to login to AWS.

## Solution

Azure Devops has **Enterprise Apps** that are used to sign into things from your O365 Account.

### AWS SSO

<Steps>

1. Under [https://aad.portal.azure.com/#allservices/category/All](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#allservices/category/All)  go to **Enterprise Applications** <img src="/assets/refarch/screen-shot-2023-01-13-at-8.33.13-am.png" height="783" width="1376" /><br/>

2. Click **New Application**

3. Choose the right application, for SSO itâ€™s **AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)**

4. Click **Create**, default options are fine

5. On the Left Panel Click **Single sign-on,** then download the XML File by Pressing the Button on step 5 **Set up AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On**) <img src="/assets/refarch/screen-shot-2023-01-13-at-8.41.28-am.png" /><br/> The Metadata file downloaded will need to be given to the CloudPosse team, as it is used in AWS for setting up SSO.

7. Similarly, Cloud Posse Team will give you an XML file from AWS SSO that contains metadata. Upload this by clicking the **Upload metadata file** button. <img src="/assets/refarch/screen-shot-2023-01-13-at-8.47.03-am.png" /><br/>

9. **SAVE**
</Steps>

### Automatic Provisioning

<Steps>
1. Cloud Posse team will provide a URL and secret via 1Password

2. Go to Your App for Single Sign On, on the left Panel go to **Provisioning**

3. Set the mode to **Automatic** and Paste the Values provided into the **Admin Credentials** Section <img src="/assets/refarch/screen-shot-2023-01-13-at-8.53.55-am.png" /><br/>
