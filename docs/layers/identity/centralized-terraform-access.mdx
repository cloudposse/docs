<Intro>
This is an overview of our approach to centralized access management and the relationships between the components used to implement it. It explains how SAML, SSO, and custom constructs for AWS teams and team roles interact to provide efficient role delegation and authentication across an AWS Organization.

## AWS Teams and Team Roles

Why do we need Teams and Team Roles when we have the same thing in Identity Center? To explain that, let’s first explain what they do and how we’ve integrated them.

### AWS Teams

The `aws-teams` component creates AWS Teams in the Identity account. The **Team** is the entry point for a group of
users, and the Identity account acts as an "Identity Hub" for centralized role assumption management across all
delegated accounts.

Think of each team as a group of users, such as `developers` or `devops`.

### AWS Team Roles

The `aws-team-roles` component defines common IAM Roles in all accounts, as well as defines the AWS Team(s) able to
assume the role in any account.

These roles should be identical in all accounts, such that you can always expect `admin` to be `admin`, `poweruser` to
be `poweruser`, and `observer` to be `observer`. The only difference between accounts is which AWS Team is able to
assume the role. We also have a `terraform` role that is used by Terraform to apply changes across all accounts.

### Example

Consider this example.

We want to enable the “DevOps” to assume Administrator in multiple accounts, such as dev or production. However, “developers” can only assume admin in dev. Here’s how that would work:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph core_identity["core-identity Teams"]
        developers["developers"]
        devops["devops"]
    end

    subgraph dev_account_roles["plat-dev Team Roles"]
        admin_dev["admin"]
    end

    subgraph prod_account_roles["plat-prod Team Roles"]
        observer_prod["observer"]
        admin_prod["admin"]
    end

    developers --> admin_dev
    developers --> observer_prod
    devops --> admin_prod
    devops --> admin_dev
```

In the `core-identity` account, we have a `developers` team and a `devops` team. Then in the `plat-dev` account, we have an `admin` team role. And in the `plat-staging` account we have an `admin` and an `observer` team role. With our design, the `developers` team can assume `admin` only in `plat-dev`, but the `devops` team can assume `admin` in both `plat-dev` and `plat-staging`.

## Using AWS Identity Center for Single Sign On

Now how does AWS IAM Identity Center fit in? Let’s see how we can connect AWS Teams and Team roles with Identity Center to complete the picture.

### Connecting a Permission Set to an AWS Team

Identity Center has the concept of Permission Sets. Permission Sets determine what a user can or cannot do. We simply connect those Permission Sets to one of our Teams.

We define a special Permission Set for the `core-identity` account, called the `Identity{X}TeamAccess` Permission Set. This Permission Set has access to assume the related AWS Team. For example, The `IdentityDeveloperTeamAccess` permission set can assume the `developers` team and the `IdentityDevopsTeamAccess` permission set can assume the `devops` team.

From their AWS Team, users can apply Terraform wherever they have access


```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph identity_center_permission_sets["Identity Center Permission Sets"]
        developer_access["IdentityDeveloperTeamAccess"]
        devops_access["IdentityDevopsTeamAccess"]
    end

    subgraph core_identity_teams["core-identity Teams"]
        developers["developers"]
        devops["devops"]
    end

    subgraph plat_sandbox_roles["plat-sandbox Team Roles"]
        terraform_sandbox["terraform"]
    end

    subgraph plat_prod_roles["plat-prod Team Roles"]
        terraform_prod["terraform"]
        planner_prod["planner"]
    end

    developer_access --> developers
    devops_access --> devops

    developers --> terraform_sandbox
    developers --> planner_prod

    devops --> terraform_sandbox
    devops --> terraform_prod
```

### Centrally Manage Users and Groups with an IdP

We still need some method to manage users and groups. AWS Teams and Team roles grant groups of users access, but do not define or manage users. AWS IAM Identity Center ties together Teams and Team roles with a predefined set of users and groups.

Although you may choose to manage users and groups directly in Identity Center, the vast majority of our customers choose to use a SAML IdP as the source of truth for their users and groups. With a SAML IdP, users and groups are not created in AWS. Instead, we connect a third-party Identity Provider, such as GSuite or JumpCloud. Then we manage all Users and Groups in that IdP

With “automatic provisioning” in AWS, we can synchronize all users and groups from the IdP into AWS. Then we can create Permission Sets in AWS to assign to those groups. We can assign Permission Sets to Groups for any given account. A Permission Set, such as `AdministratorAccess` or `ReadOnlyAccess`, is granted to a given group for some account. This way, we only need to define the Permission Sets once each

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph external_idp["External Identity Provider"]
        user1["User 1"]
        user2["User 2"]
        user3["User 3"]
        group1["Group 1"]
        user1 --> group1
        user2 --> group1
        user3 --> group1
    end

    subgraph aws_iam_identity_center["AWS IAM Identity Center"]
        user1_copy["User 1 Copy"]
        user2_copy["User 2 Copy"]
        user3_copy["User 3 Copy"]
        group1_copy["Group 1 Copy"]
        permissions["Permission Sets"]
        user1_copy -.-> group1_copy
        user2_copy -.-> group1_copy
        user3_copy -.-> group1_copy
        group1_copy --> permissions
    end

    external_idp -->|Automatic Provisioning| aws_iam_identity_center
```

### Access the AWS Web Console with Identity Center

With Identity Center, it’s very easy to log into the AWS web console. Simply open the Single Sign On Portal link, and select the account and role you want to access.

For example, if I wanted to connect to `plat-prod` with “Read Only” access, then I would select the `ReadOnlyAccess` Permission Set for `plat-prod`. Then AWS will launch a new session with the appropriate permissions in production


### Deploying both AWS IAM Identity Center and AWS SAML

AWS IAM Identity Center and AWS SAML are not mutually exclusive solutions. They can be used together to provide a seamless login experience for users. Cloud Posse frequently deploys both in customer environments - AWS SAML to log in ourselves for the duration of the engagement and AWS IAM Identity Center for the customer to use and support. That way the customer can access AWS via their chosen Identity Provider (IdP), and we can use G-Suite SAML to access the Identity account team directly. When an enagement is complete, we can easily decommission our access by removing the SAML connection.

:::tip AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS SAML? Which do I choose?

The vast majority of our customers prefer AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO). The convenience of a web console login is hard to beat. However, some customers prefer SAML for its simplicity and compatibility with existing systems. We support both methods, and you can choose the one that best fits your needs.

## FAQ

### Why use AWS SAML?

The `aws-saml` component provides SAML access for Admin users to connect to the Identity account admin role `aws-teams`
without AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On).

This component creates an Identity Provider (IdP) in the Identity account to allow federated access to an identity role.
Follow the Identity Providers documentation for adding a SAML login.

With AWS SAML, we create a federated SAML login that connects to the "team" in the identity account, and then users can assume other roles from there. We use the [AWS Extend Switch Roles plugin](https://github.com/tilfinltd/aws-extend-switch-roles) that makes this much easier, but it's not as intuitive as Identity Center.

### How do I use AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)?

The `aws-sso` component connects AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On) Groups to Permission Sets.
Permission Sets grant access to `aws-teams` in the Identity account or (optional) access to an individual account for
convenience.

Permission Sets other than the Identity Team Access Permission Set are used only for console and cli access to a single
account. These are redundant with AWS Team Roles but are useful for quickly accessing a given account with limited
permission.

With AWS IAM Identity Center, you can directly access a specific account from the single sign-on page, which will automatically assume the role with the associated `PermissionSet`. This is great for web console usage but not ideal for locally applying Terraform. With Terraform, we need to apply changes across many accounts, where each account has its own role. We don't want to assume a new role each time we change accounts. To solve this, we have a specific Permission Set that can assume an AWS team role in the identity account. When applying Terraform, we assume that "team" role via SSO, and when accessing the web console, we use the Permission Set directly.
