<Intro>
This guide provides an overview of setting up AWS Identity Center (SSO) with ClickOps, detailing prerequisites and supported external identity providers. It explains how to integrate AWS SSO with providers like Azure AD, JumpCloud, Okta, and Google Workspace, including specific steps for configuring each.
</Intro>

## How it Works

AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is a service that simplifies access management for AWS accounts and applications. It enables users to sign in to AWS once and access multiple AWS accounts and applications without the need to re-enter credentials. To use it with an identity provider (e.g. such as Okta) for AWS SSO, administrators typically need to configure the integration within the AWS Management Console.
This involves setting up a new AWS SSO instance, connecting it the IdP, and specifying the users or groups that should have access to AWS resources. AWS SSO provides logging and auditing capabilities, allowing organizations to track user access to AWS resources and monitor security-related events

<Steps>
  1. **SAML-Based Authentication**

     The integration between the IdP and AWS SSO relies on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for authentication and authorization. SAML enables the exchange of authentication and authorization data between Okta and AWS, allowing users to log in once to Okta and gain access to AWS resources without additional logins.


  2. **User Provisioning**

      AWS SSO can be configured to automatically provision and de-provision user accounts based on changes in the IdP directory. This helps keep user access in sync with changes made in the Okta environment.

  3.  **AWS SSO Permission Sets**

      AWS SSO allows administrators to define fine-grained access policies, specifying which AWS accounts and services users from the IdP can access

  3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

     Organizations using Okta for authentication with AWS SSO can enhance security by enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added identity verification.
</Steps>

Once configured, users can experience single sign-on when accessing AWS resources. They log in to their IdP account and seamlessly gain access to AWS without needing to provide credentials again.


It's important to note that the specifics of the integration process may be subject to updates or changes, so it's recommended to refer to the official AWS documentation and Okta documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your current date.


## Prerequisites

First, enable the AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) service in the `core-root` account. This is the account where the `aws-sso` component will be deployed.

<Steps>
  1. Navigate to the `core-root` account in the AWS Web Console
  2. Select your primary region
  3. Go to AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)
  4. Enable the service
</Steps>


## Configure your Identity Provider

These are the instructions for the most common Identity Providers. Alternatives are available, but the steps may vary depending on the provider.

It's important to note that the specifics of the integration process may be subject to updates or changes, so it's recommended to refer to the official AWS documentation and respective IdP documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your current date.

For providers not included in the following section, please [follow the AWS documentation for setting up an IdP integration with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/supported-idps.html). This list includes Azure AD, CyberArk, OneLogin, and Ping Identity.

    ### Setup Okta
    <Steps>
      1. Under the Admin Panel go to **Applications**
      2. Click **Browse App Catalog**
      3. Search for `AWS IAM Identity Center` and click **Add Integration**
      4. Keep the default settings of **App Label** ("AWS IAM Identity Center") and **Application Visibility**
      5. Go to **Sign On** and Copy information from the SAML Metadata section, this will be used in AWS SSO.
      6. Then go to Provisioning and click **Configure API Integration**
    </Steps>

    ### Setup AWS SSO

    <Steps>
      1. Sign into AWS SSO under your management account (`core-root`)
      2. Go to the AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) application
      3. Enable IAM Identity Center
      4. On the left panel click **Settings**
      5. Under Identity Source click edit and add an **External identity provider**
      6. Copy the information from Okta into the fields
      7. The Okta App will need to be updated with the **Service provider metadata**
    </Steps>

  <TabItem value="gsuite" label="GSuite and Other External IdPs">
    <Intro>
      For non-explicitly supported Identity Providers, such as GSuite, set up the app integration with a custom external
      identity provider. The steps may be different for each IdP, but the goal is ultimately the same.
    </Intro>

    :::tip aws-ssosync

    GSuite does not automatically sync _both_ Users and Groups with AWS Identity Center without additional configuration! If using
    GSuite as an IdP, considering deploying the [ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) tool.

    Please see our [aws-ssosync component](/components/library/aws/aws-ssosync/) for details!

    :::

    <Steps>
      1. Open the Identity account in the AWS Console
      2. On the Dashboard page of the IAM Identity Center console, select Choose your identity source
      3. In the Settings, choose the Identity source tab, select the Actions dropdown in the top right, and then select Change
        identity source
      4. By default, IAM Identity Center uses its own directory as the IdP. To use another IdP, you have to switch to an
        external identity provider. Select External identity provider from the available identity sources
      5. Configure the custom SAML application with the Service provider metadata generated from your IdP. Follow the next
        steps from your IdP, and then complete this AWS configuration afterwards
      6. Open your chosen IdP
      7. Create a new SSO application
      8. Download the new app's IdP metadata and use this to complete step 5 above
      9. Fill in the Service provider details using the data from IAM Identity Center, and then choose Continue. The mapping
        for the data is as follows:

          ```console
          For ACS URL, enter the IAM Identity Center Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.
          For Entity ID, enter the IAM Identity Center issuer URL.
          Leave the Start URL field empty.
          For Name ID format, select EMAIL.
          ```

      10. If required for the IdP, enable the application for all users
      11. Finally, define specific Groups to match the given Group names by the aws-sso component
          (`stacks/catalog/aws-sso.yaml`). In the default catalog, we define four Groups: `DevOps`, `Developers`,
          `BillingAdmin`, and `Everyone`
    </Steps>

    If set up properly, Users and Groups added to your IdP will automatically populate and update in AWS.
