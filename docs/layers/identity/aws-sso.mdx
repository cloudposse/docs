<Intro>
  This guide provides an overview of setting up AWS Identity Center (SSO) with
  ClickOps, detailing prerequisites and supported external identity providers.
  It explains how to integrate AWS SSO with providers like Azure AD, JumpCloud,
  Okta, and Google Workspace, including specific steps for configuring each.
</Intro>

## How it Works

AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is a service that simplifies access management for AWS accounts and applications. It enables users to sign in to AWS once and access multiple AWS accounts and applications without the need to re-enter credentials. To use it with an identity provider (IdP) for AWS SSO, administrators typically need to configure the integration within the AWS Management Console. This involves setting up a new AWS SSO instance, connecting it to the IdP, and specifying the users or groups that should have access to AWS resources. AWS SSO provides logging and auditing capabilities, allowing organizations to track user access to AWS resources and monitor security-related events.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> SAML-Based Authentication

    The integration between the IdP and AWS SSO relies on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for authentication and authorization. SAML enables the exchange of authentication and authorization data between your IdP and AWS, allowing users to log in once to their IdP and gain access to AWS resources without additional logins.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> User Provisioning

    AWS SSO can be configured to automatically provision and de-provision user accounts based on changes in the IdP directory. This helps keep user access in sync with changes made in your IdP.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> AWS SSO Permission Sets

    AWS SSO allows administrators to define fine-grained access policies, specifying which AWS accounts and services users from the IdP can access.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

    Organizations using an IdP for authentication with AWS SSO can enhance security by enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added identity verification.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Once configured, users can experience single sign-on when accessing AWS resources. They log in to their IdP account and seamlessly gain access to AWS without needing to provide credentials again.

It's important to note that the specifics of the integration process may be subject to updates or changes, so it's recommended to refer to the official AWS documentation and your IdP's documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

## Prerequisites

First, enable the AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) service in the `core-root` account. This is the account where the `aws-sso` component will be deployed.

<Steps>
  1. **Navigate** to the `core-root` account in the AWS Web Console
  1. **Select** your primary region
  1. **Go to** AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)
  1. **Enable** the service
</Steps>

## Configure your Identity Provider

These are the instructions for the most common Identity Providers. Alternatives are available, but the steps may vary depending on the provider.

It's important to note that the specifics of the integration process may be subject to updates or changes, so it's recommended to refer to the official AWS documentation and respective IdP documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your current date.

For providers not included in the following section, please [follow the AWS documentation for setting up an IdP integration with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/supported-idps.html). This list includes Azure AD, CyberArk, OneLogin, and Ping Identity.

  <TabItem value="gsuite" label="GSuite and Other External IdPs">
    <Intro>
      For non-explicitly supported Identity Providers, such as GSuite, set up the app integration with a custom external
      identity provider. The steps may be different for each IdP, but the goal is ultimately the same.
    </Intro>

    :::tip aws-ssosync

    GSuite does not automatically sync _both_ Users and Groups with AWS Identity Center without additional configuration! If using
    GSuite as an IdP, considering deploying the [ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) tool.

    Please see our [aws-ssosync component](/components/library/aws/aws-ssosync/) for details!

    :::

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Open the Identity account in the AWS Console
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> On the Dashboard page of the IAM Identity Center console, select Choose your identity source
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> In the Settings, choose the Identity source tab, select the Actions dropdown in the top right, and then select Change identity source
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> By default, IAM Identity Center uses its own directory as the IdP. To use another IdP, you have to switch to an external identity provider. Select External identity provider from the available identity sources
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Configure the custom SAML application with the Service provider metadata generated from your IdP. Follow the next steps from your IdP, and then complete this AWS configuration afterwards
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Open your chosen IdP
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Create a new SSO application
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Download the new app's IdP metadata and use this to complete step 5 above
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Fill in the Service provider details using the data from IAM Identity Center, and then choose Continue. The mapping for the data is as follows:

```
For ACS URL, enter the IAM Identity Center Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.
For Entity ID, enter the IAM Identity Center issuer URL.
Leave the Start URL field empty.
For Name ID format, select EMAIL.
```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> If required for the IdP, enable the application for all users
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <StepNumber/> Finally, define specific Groups to match the given Group names by the `aws-sso` component (`stacks/catalog/aws-sso.yaml`). In the default catalog, we define four Groups: `DevOps`, `Developers`, `BillingAdmin`, and `Everyone`
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    If set up properly, Users and Groups added to your IdP will automatically populate and update in AWS.

    Additional IdP specific setup reference can be found here:

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Required Groups

Before deploying the `aws-sso` component, you must create the following groups in your Identity Provider. These names are **case-sensitive** and must match exactly:

<Steps>
  1. **Managers** — Full access to all accounts
  1. **DevOps** — Full access to most accounts (except root)
  1. **Developers** — Limited access for development work
  1. **BillingAdmin** — Access to billing and cost management
</Steps>

Once these groups are provisioned and synced to AWS Identity Center, you can deploy the `aws-sso` component.

## Deploy Permission Sets

The `aws-sso` component deploys all Permission Sets and assigns them to the appropriate groups. This includes:

<Steps>
  1. **`TerraformApplyAccess`** — Write access for Terraform operations
  1. **`TerraformPlanAccess`** — Read-only access for Terraform plan operations
  1. **`TerraformStateAccess`** — Access to Terraform state only
  1. **`AdministratorAccess`** — Full AWS administrator access
  1. **`PowerUserAccess`** — Power user access without IAM management
  1. **`ReadOnlyAccess`** — Read-only access to AWS resources
  1. **`RootAccess`** — Organizational root access for privileged operations (see [Centralized Root Access](/layers/identity/centralized-root-access/))
</Steps>

The `aws-sso` component is responsible for deploying all Permission Sets and mapping them to the appropriate groups per account. This mapping is configured in `stacks/catalog/aws-sso.yaml`, where you define which groups receive which Permission Sets for each account type. This is how you assign permissions to users — by adding them to the appropriate IdP group, they automatically receive the corresponding Permission Sets when they access AWS.

Deploy the component using the identity workflow:

<AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/sso" fileName="quickstart/foundation/identity" />

:::caution Groups Must Exist First
The `aws-sso` component will fail if the required groups (`Managers`, `DevOps`, `Developers`, `BillingAdmin`) do not exist in AWS Identity Center. Ensure your IdP is configured and groups are synced before deploying.
