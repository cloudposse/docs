# Centralized Root Access

:::info Work in Progress
This documentation is being written as part of the account-map deprecation effort.
:::

## Overview

The `RootAccess` permission set enables organizational root access to delegated AWS accounts. This allows managers to perform root-level operations without needing the root account credentials.

## Permission Set Configuration

The `RootAccess` permission set is configured in the `aws-sso` component and provides `sts:AssumeRoot` permissions.

## Using Organizational Root Access

Managers can use the `organizational-root-access` identity to assume root access:

```yaml
# In profiles/managers/atmos.yaml
organizational-root-access:
  kind: aws/permission-set
  via:
    provider: sso
  principal:
    name: RootAccess
    account:
      name: core-root
```

## Security Considerations

- Only assign `RootAccess` to trusted users (typically managers only)
- Use for emergency access and specific administrative tasks
- Audit all usage of organizational root access
