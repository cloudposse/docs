<Intro>
  Simplify AWS authentication by leveraging existing email providers or Identity
  Providers (IdPs), ensuring streamlined access management and ease of use for
  your team.
</Intro>

## Problem

Users need a way to authenticate to AWS.

## Solution

Verified working IdPs:

- GSuite (Google Workspaces)
- Office 365 (Microsoft Entra ID)
- Okta
- JumpCloud
- Auth0

Cloud Posse recommends using your existing email provider (e.g. Google, Microsoft, etc) as the IdP, unless you
already have a specialized one, such as Okta, Auth0, or JumpCloud.

## Consequences

Follow the steps below to integrate your IdP of choice with AWS.

<Note title="Jumpstart">
  Cloud Posse requires this information for your team to sign in to the new AWS
  Accounts.
  <TaskList>
    - [ ] Please create a temporary User in your IdP for the Cloud Posse Team.
    The Cloud Posse Team will use this account to verify access to several
    resources. For example `cloudposse@acme.com`.
