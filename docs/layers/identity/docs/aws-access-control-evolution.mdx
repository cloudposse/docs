## Overview

Unsurprisingly, Cloud Posse has evolved its approach to access control over time.
This article documents that evolution in terms of "feature sets" that were added over time.
The intent is to help people understand which version of the access control system
they are currently using, how it integrates with current and future versions of
the Reference Architecture and Components, what features are available but not yet
imported into their system, and what are the benefits of upgrading.

This article is not intended as an upgrade guide. Upgrade guides are scattered
in release notes and individual component READMEs and CHANGELOGs. This article
is intended to help you understand what you have and what you can have, and
to help you decide when and if you want to upgrade.

This article does not cover allowing GitHub actions to access AWS via OIDC.

### Features are Both Code and Configuration

The features described here are implemented in both code and configuration.
Some upgrades require changes to all of the related components,
some only to some of them. Sometimes, only a single component
needs to be upgraded. Sometimes, if the components are already feature-capable,
then only configuration changes are needed.

The components involved are:

- `account-map`
- `aws-saml`
- `aws-sso`
- `aws-team-roles`
- `aws-teams`
- `tfstate-backend`

The configuration involved is usually a change to the stacks, but if the
input or local variable name begins with `overridable_`, then it must be
overridden with a `*_override.tf` file in the same directory as
where the variable is defined, and the override accomplished by changing
the default or local value.

### Component Versions

The feature set descriptions below may reference specific versions of the
[terraform-aws-components](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-component)
and/or Pull Requests (PRs) in that repository. The versions and PRs refer to
where the feature was first introduced, as that is often the best place to
find upgrade information and more details about the feature. However, there
are often refinements and bug fixes in later versions, so at all times
it is advisable to use the latest version of the component consistent with
the feature set you are using.

Pull Request numbers are used because until the pull request is merged,
there is no version number associated with it.

## Roadmap

These features are being considered for future implementation. If you wish to
have them, please contact Cloud Posse to discuss how to get them implemented.

### SSO Permission Sets Automatically Acquire Team Permissions

When the SSO Permission Set corresponding to a Team is created, it should
automatically be granted the permissions that the Team has in the `identity` account.
Currently, the sets have minimal permissions in the `identity` account, although
they have the exact same ability to assume roles in other accounts as the Team does.

## Feature Sets (reverse chronological order)


### SSO Permission Sets as Teams

- Components [version 1.238.0](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.238.0)
- Components [PR 738](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/738)
- Required component updates: `aws-sso`, `account-map`
- Required configuration update complexity: minimal
- Optional compatibility settings:
  - `account-map/modules/roles-to-principals`:
    - `overridable_team_permission_set_name_pattern`: Set to `Identity%sRoleAccess` if your existing permission sets
       end with "RoleAccess" rather than "TeamAccess"
    - `overridable_team_permission_sets_enabled`: Set to `false` to disable this feature
- Forensics: You have this version or later if `account-map/modules/roles-to-principals/variables.tf`
contains the `overridable_team_permission_sets_enabled` variable.

#### Before

Previously, for each `aws-team`, there was a configuration in `aws-sso` that
enabled automatically creating a corresponding `Identity<team-name>TeamAccess`
permission set in the `identity` account. This permission set was then granted
the ability to assume the corresponding `aws-team` IAM role in the `identity`
account. This allowed SSO users to have a workflow like this (in this
example, they are accessing the `devops` team):

- Log into AWS SSO, selecting the `identity` account and the
`IdentityDevopsTeamAccess` permission set.
- Assume the `<namespace>-core-gbl-identity-devops` role in the `identity` account
in either of 2 ways:
  - Use the "chained session" feature of Leapp to assume the role (preferred)
  - Use the Geodesic `assume-role` command-line function to assume the role

#### After

With this update, the Team Access permission sets will directly be able to assume
all the same roles as the corresponding `aws-teams` can. This eliminates the need
to assume the `aws-team` IAM role in the `identity` account via chained sessions
or an explicit `assume-role` command.

### SAML Login High Availability

- Components [version 1.238.0](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.238.0)
- Components [PR 738](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/738)
- Required component updates: `aws-saml`
- Required configuration update complexity: none, but `aws-saml` must be reapplied to take advantage of the new features.
- Forensics: You have this feature if `aws-saml/main.tf` allows for multiple
values of the `SAML:aud` policy variable, and not only `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`

#### Before

Although the `aws-saml` component is global in scope, the trust policy that
was being deployed required you to log in via `us-east-1`. If that region
was having an outage, you could not log in.

#### After

The IdP's trust policy has been updated to allow you to log in via any region.
To change login regions, just update the IdP's `ACS URL` to use
the [AWS sign-in endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signin-service.html)
for the region you want to log in via. Keep in mind that the IdP may take
a few minutes to make the change available to your users.

Depending on your priorities, you may want to change your default `ACS URL`
to use the AWS sign-in endpoint for either your primary or fail-over region.
Setting it to your fail-over region will allow you to log in even if your
primary region is having an outage.

---

### SAML Access Auditing

- Components [version 1.238.0](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.238.0)
- Components [PR 738](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/738)
- Required component updates: `account-map`, `aws-saml`, `aws-sso`
- Required configuration update complexity: none, but the following components
  must be reapplied to take advantage of the new features:
  - `aws-saml`
  - `aws-sso`
  - `aws-team-roles`
  - `aws-teams`
  - `tfstate-backend`
- Forensics: You have this feature if every trust policy for user roles (not
necessarily EKS IRSA, GitHub Actions roles, or AWS service-linked roles) has the
`sts:SetSourceIdentity` permission. Search for relevant trust policies by looking for the
`sts:TagSession` permission.


#### Before

Nearly all of the work done in deploying and maintaining resources is done
by "assumed roles". Auditing who the real person is that is doing the work
was difficult to impossible, and probably could be circumvented by a malicious
actor. This is because the only indication of user's identity was
in the IAM session name, which can be changed by the user.

#### After

To make auditing who is using an assumed role easier and more reliable,
AWS introduced the concept of a
[source identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html)
that can be set by the identity provider (IdP) when the user logs in and cannot
be changed after it is set. In order for that to be useful, the IdP and
all the roles to be assumed must have the `sts:SetSourceIdentity` permission.
(See [Permissions required to set source identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html#id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor-perms).)

With this update:

- `aws-saml` will automatically add this permission to the IdP
- `aws-team-roles` will automatically include this permission in the trust policies of all the roles it creates
- `aws-teams`'s minimal `team-role-access` policy includes this permission

**Important Note:** This update does **NOT** configure the IdP to set the Source Identity.
That must be done in the IdP itself, by including the `https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/SourceIdentity`
attribute in the SAML assertion.
See [SourceIdentity SAML attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_assertions.html#saml_sourceidentity) for more information.
However, once that attribute is added to the SAMl assertion, the Source Identity
should work automatically from there.

### Dynamic Terraform Roles, Normalization of Team Roles, Better Team and Team Role IAM Policy Management

- Introduced in Components [version 1.227.0](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.227.0)
  - Due to refinements, the minimum recommended version for this feature is
    [version 1.242.0](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.242.0)
- Components [PR 715](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/715), further refined
in PRs
  - [730](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/730)
  - [740](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/740)
  - [748](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/748)
- Required component updates:
  - `account-map`
  - `aws-team-roles`
  - `aws-teams`
  - `tfstate-backend`
  - ALL components that want to take advantage of the new features need to be updated. Ideally, the whole component
   would be updated, but in most cases, it will be sufficient to update `providers.tf` within the component to v1.238.0
   or later.
- Required configuration update complexity: none if you update to v1.242.0 or later and do not want any of these features
- Full implementation configuration update complexity: large, but easy to understand
- Forensics: You have this feature if
  - The `account-map` component includes the `dynamic-roles.tf` file
  - The `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` components include an `additional-policy-map.tf` file
  - The `tfstate-backend/iam.tf` file has a statement like this (line 38 in v1.227.0), including `local.caller_arn`
    in `allowed_principal_arns`:

```hcl
allowed_principal_arns = concat(each.value.allowed_principal_arns, [local.caller_arn])
```

:::warning Using profile names instead of IAM roles ARNs is deprecated

For a brief period, the Cloud Posse architecture suggested using `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` profiles instead of IAM role ARNs
to assume roles in target accounts, due to insufficient support for using IAM role ARNs with AWS SSO. With this
feature release, support for using profiles is deprecated, because the Cloud Posse reference architecture has
evolved to the point where there is no longer any benefit (and there are some drawbacks) to using profiles. While
historical use of profiles will continue to work, the features described here will not work with profiles. If you
are using profiles, we recommend you switch to IAM roles and SSO Permission Sets if you are unsatisfied with the
support of profiles.

:::

#### Summary of new features

- A new class of access, "Terraform plan only", can be given to Teams. Team members can preview changes but not make them.
- Users in production accounts (not assigned to "teams") can now be allowed to run Terraform in those accounts with
  whatever permissions the user has in those accounts. This is particularly useful for developers or others who only need
  access to a small number of accounts.
- Most components that previously could only be managed by SuperAdmin can now be managed by any user with the
  appropriate permissions.
- It is now easier to understand the relationships and distinctions between "Teams" and "Team Roles" because there
  is no longer any overlap in names and there are no more special cases.
- Configuration files for the `aws` CLI and the "AWS Extend Switch Roles" browser plugin are now generated from automatically
  generated Terraform outputs, so they can be updated by running a simple Atmos workflow.
- Most custom IAM policies have been removed in favor of using AWS-managed policies.
- Obsolete, dedicated outputs from `account-map/modules/iam-roles` in support of `helm` and `cicd` teams have been
  disabled to discourage future use, but not completely eliminated to minimize the impact on existing code which may
  reference the outputs without actually using them.

#### Background

Both before and after this update, all Terraform usage requires the use of 3 or 4 AWS
IAM roles:

- The "user" role: The initial role of the user when executing the Terraform command (with or without `atmos`)
- The "backend" role: The role assumed by Terraform to access the Terraform State backend to read and update the state
- The "remote state" role (when needed): the role assumed by Terraform to access the Terraform State backend to read the state of other components
- The "Terraform assumed role": The role automatically assumed by Terraform in the target account to make the requested changes

Note that the "remote state role" and the "Terraform assumed role" can be configured per user, the other 2 roles cannot.
The "user" role is, of necessity, whatever IAM role the user presents credentials for. The "backend" role is the role
that Terraform is configured to assume to access the Terraform State backend, which must be accessible before any other
configuration can take place. (While it would be possible to use Atmos to configure a backend role based on the user's
role, that would make it impossible to use Terraform without Atmos, which is a situation we want to avoid.)


##### The usage of the "user" role

Of necessity, the user issuing a Terraform (or Atmos) command can only be doing so with the credentials of
a single IAM role. This role is called the "user" role. In a desire to simplify operations, the other roles
necessary to execute the Terraform command are assumed by Terraform itself, and the user role is only used
to access these other roles.

However, the user role is still a full-fledged IAM role, and can be used to access any AWS resources that the
user has permissions to access. So for security reasons, it is desirable to limit the direct permissions of
the user role and to limit access to the roles under the principle of "least privilege". So to begin with, we
create a separate account called the "identity" account which exists for the sole purpose of managing "user"
IAM roles, which we now refer to as "aws teams". This means that even if a user gets full Administrator access
to the account, they will not be able to access any AWS resources other than IAM roles. In particular, they will
not be able to make changes in the Organization `root` account, which is the most sensitive account, unless they are
further granted permission to assume a role in the `root` account.

In many organizations, it is desirable to restrict even the most privileged users from being able to routinely manage
the most sensitive resources, such as creating or changing IAM roles and policies in the `root` or `identity` accounts,
so they may grant or restrict the access of the user roles accordingly.

##### The SuperAdmin role

Before any of the user (or other) IAM roles can be created by Terraform, a role must be created manually (via "Click Ops")
to allow Terraform to create the other roles. This role is called the "SuperAdmin" role. It is created in
the `root` account and has full AdministratorAccess permissions in the `root` account. It can also assume
the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in any other account, giving it full AdministratorAccess to all accounts.

Because this role is a technical necessity, some organizations choose to use it as the only way to make
changes in the sensitive accounts, while others choose to enable certain teams to also make changes to
them. In any case, creation of the IAM roles that make up "user" roles, and all the prerequisites for them,
such as creating a Terraform state backend and the AWS accounts themselves, must be done by the SuperAdmin role.

##### Technical limitations of the Terraform state backend and "remote state"

**Terraform state backend**: Terraform stores information about how it expects resources are currently deployed in a "state file" in
the Terraform state backend. This state file is updated whenever Terraform makes changes to resources.
When Terraform is run, it uses the state file and the current configuration to determine what changes
need to be made to bring the resources into the desired state. In this situation, this is called the
"backend" or "Terraform state".

**Remote state**: Terraform can also read the state files of other components to determine how they are configured and
use that information to guide the creation of the current component's resources. For example, a component
can access the state of the `vpc` component to determine the VPC ID and subnets to use for its resources.
This is called "remote state", although it is stored in the same Terraform state "backend" as the current
component's state.

**Technical limitations**: The Terraform state backend is made up of 2 components: an S3 bucket and a DynamoDB table.
The S3 bucket stores the state files, and the DynamoDB table is used to lock the state files to prevent concurrent
updates and detect data corruption. Because the Terraform state backend is provisioned when only the `root` account
exists, the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table are provisioned in the `root` account. While the
S3 bucket supports cross-account access directly, via bucket policies, the DynamoDB table does not. So to allow
users in the `identity` account to access the Terraform state backend in the root account, we must create an IAM
role in the same account where the DynamoDB table is provisioned (the `root` account), and allow the users to assume that role.
This role is called the "backend" role or the "Terraform state read/write role".

To read the "remote state" of other components, we can either use the "backend" role or create a separate role for that
purpose. This role is called the "remote state" role or the "Terraform state read-only role" (although, to be useful,
the "read-only" role still has to have read/write access to the DynamoDB table).

Before the user roles are created in the `identity` account and the backend role is created in the `root` account,
only the SuperAdmin role (which is also in the `root` account) can access the Terraform state backend.

##### The "Terraform assumed role"

In order to make changes to AWS infrastructure in an account, Terraform must assume a role in that account.
The "Terraform assumed role" is the role that Terraform assumes in the target account to make the requested changes.

#### Before

Prior to this update, the design and configuration of these roles and the access to them evolved over years,
as new features were added to Terraform and as Atmos was introduced and developed, without a holistic (re-)design
process, resulting in a hodgepodge. The following description of the resulting system is presented to describe it,
not justify it.

##### Confusion between "team" and "team role" names, inconsistent usage

Although components [PR 438](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/438), version 1.27.0,
brought a change from `iam-primary-roles` and `iam-delegated-roles` to `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles`,
the change was not complete. The components were renamed and the implementation changed to make them separate,
but the configuration was not updated to follow through on the concept. The teams had the same names as the team-roles
(e.g. `admin`, `terraform`) and for security reasons, the `terraform` role in the `root` and `identity` accounts
did not behave like they did in other accounts.

In the `identity` account, the `terraform` role was a team role without permission to make changes in the `identity` account.
In the `root` account, the `terraform` role was the "Terraform state backend" role and again had no permissions to make
changes in the `root` account.

The "Terraform assumed role" for the `root` and `identity` accounts was the `admin` role.

##### The "Terraform state backend" role was managed by `aws-team-roles`, causing problems for remote state

The "Terraform state backend" role was `root-terraform` and was deployed by the `aws-team-roles` component in the `root`
account. Because it was managed by `aws-team-roles`, it was not available until after all the team roles had been provisioned.
This meant that any components that needed to be deployed before the team roles were provisioned could not use the Terraform
state backend role, and had to be provisioned by SuperAdmin and _only_ SuperAdmin. Furthermore, it meant that no
Terraform state backend role could be configured for the component, but the role would not be available for SuperAdmin
to assume.

Although only SuperAdmin could provision certain components, we still wanted any component to be able to read the
component's remote state. We had been using the backend role for this purpose, but now we had components with
no backend role configured. This led to the creation of the concept of a "remote state" role. This configuration
was only used to look up remote state and could be set to use the backend role for components that were
deployed after the role was created.

Unfortunately, SuperAdmin still could not use this remote state role, so we added an extra flag called `privileged`.
When set to `true`, the remote state role would be ignored and the user's role (presumably SuperAdmin) would be used
as the remote state role instead.

In sum: backend access was controlled by 3 settings: `backend.s3.role_arn`, `remote_state_backend.s3.role_arn`,
and `var.privileged`, and still was not as flexible as we would like, because it still meant that only SuperAdmin could
manage certain components.

##### Each component could have only one "Terraform assumed role" per account

For each component, there was a single mapping of accounts to "Terraform assumed roles". This meant that
every user either had full access to make changes or no access at all, because they either were or were not
allowed to assume the "Terraform assumed role" for that account. There was no ability to give users partial (e.g.
read-only) access, and no ability to give SSO users logged directly into a target account to use their "user" role's
permissions to have tailored access to make changes.

Furthermore, it meant that if SuperAdmin needed to be able to Terraform the component, no one else could Terraform it,
because SuperAdmin could not assume any of the roles that other users could assume.

##### AWS configuration files were manually maintained

An `aws-accounts` script was manually maintained and used, among other things, to generate configuration files for the
`aws` CLI and the "AWS Extend Switch Roles" browser plugin. Updating this script was a manual process that was
error-prone and tedious, and frequently neglected. As a result, new accounts or new roles were not added to these
configuration files in a timely manner.

##### Provided IAM policies were static even though based on dynamic AWS managed policies

The `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` components provided a set of IAM policies that could be assigned. However, in
several cases, these policies were run-time concatenations of AWS managed policies, which meant that when
AWS updated the policies, the updates did not automatically flow through to the roles. This became a live problem
[when AWS updated the Billing IAM actions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/changes-to-aws-billing-cost-management-and-account-consoles-permissions/)
and the policies needed to be updated.

#### After

##### Team Role names are normalized and distinct from Team names

Through configuration changes, along with support from `account-map`, the names of the team roles are now normalized
so that all accounts use the `terraform` role as the default Terraform assumed role. The `root` and `identity` accounts
are no longer treated specially.

The Team names are distinct from the Team Role names, allowing `aws-team-roles` to be deployed to the `identity` account.

This completes the separation of the concepts of "team" and "team role", with "team" being analogous to a "group" in
a traditional access control system, in that it is a single entity that allows access to multiple other entities.

##### The "Terraform state backend" role is managed by `tfstate-backend`, allowing it to be used by all

The "Terraform state backend" role is now managed by `tfstate-backend`, meaning it is created as part of the first Terraform
step, which enables it to be used by all users and components. This means that SuperAdmin can now assume the role, so
all components can be configured with the backend role, and the `remote_state_backend.s3.role_arn` configuration and
the `privileged` flag are no longer needed.

This removes one of the barriers to allowing users other than SuperAdmin to manage components that are first created
before the team roles are created. It also means that, if desired, users in accounts other than the `identity` account
can be given access to the Terraform state backend role, allowing them to use Terraform to manage the account associated
with their "user" role.

##### Each component can have multiple "Terraform assumed roles" per account

Previously, the "Terraform assumed role" for each account (after normalization) was the `terraform` role. The `terraform`
role still works as before, and with this upgrade there are 2 new possibilities:

1. There is automated support for a new Team Role called `planner`, the intention being that `planner` would have enough
permissions to run `terraform plan` and see what would change if a Terraform `apply` command were run, but not enough
permissions to actually make the changes. It can be used for drift detection or to preview changes.
2. If a user does not have permission to assume the `terraform` or `planner` roles, then Terraform will not assume any
role, and instead will use the user's role to make changes. This allows SSO users to log directly into a target account
and use their "user" role's permissions to have tailored access to make changes. It also allows SuperAdmin to make changes
in the `root` account while still allowing authorized Team members to make changes using their Team roles.

##### Updates to AWS configuration files are mostly automatic

The `aws-accounts` script has been replaced by the `aws-config` script, which uses files automatically generated by
Terraform components `account-map`, `aws-teams`, and `aws-team-roles` to generate configuration files for the
`aws` CLI and the "AWS Extend Switch Roles" browser plugin. After updates to the relevant components, the configuration
files can be updated by running the following:

<AtmosWorkflow workflow="update-aws-config" fileName="identity" />

was manually maintained and used, among other things, to generate configuration files for the
`aws` CLI and the "AWS Extend Switch Roles" browser plugin. Updating this script was a manual process that was
error-prone and tedious, and frequently neglected. As a result, new accounts or new roles were not added to these
configuration files in a timely manner.

##### Custom IAM policies based on AWS-managed Policies have been removed

The provided IAM policies are now limited to non-AWS-managed policies, which means that the policies are truly custom
and cannot benefit from automatic AWS updates. Policies that can benefit from automatic AWS updates are now configured
directly in the Team and Team Role configuration. So instead of the custom, non-updating `billing_read_only` policy:

```yaml
billing:
  role_policy_arns:
  - "billing_read_only"
```

You would use the AWS-managed `job-function/Billing` policy:

```yaml
billing:
  role_policy_arns:
    - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess"
```

This gives you the benefit of automatic updates to the policy, and you can still customize the policy by adding
an additional custom policy if you want to.

### Preserve Custom `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` IAM Policies on Upgrade

- Components [version 1.216.1](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.216.1)
- Components [PR 697](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/697)
- Required component updates: `aws-teams`, `aws-team-roles`
- Required configuration update complexity: none
- Forensics: You have this feature if the `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` components have an `additional-policy-map.tf` file

#### Before

##### Custom IAM policies were overwritten on upgrade

In order to add your own custom IAM policies to `aws-teams` or `aws-team-roles`,
you had to modify the component code itself. This meant that when you upgraded
the component, your changes would be overwritten.

#### After

##### Custom IAM policies are preserved on upgrade

Users can now create custom IAM policies and integrate them with the `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` components by
taking advantage of the Terraform [override feature](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/override).
This allows users to add custom IAM policies to Teams and Team Roles that will not be overwritten by updates to the
components, while still getting any new IAM policies added by the component.

---

### Conversion From iam-primary-roles to aws-teams

**Special note**: Although this section documents the conversion from `iam-primary-roles` to `aws-teams` as it was first
introduced, several advancements (documented above) have been made since then. The recommended approach for converting
from `iam-primary-roles` to `aws-teams` is to upgrade to the latest versions of the `account-map`, `aws-teams`,
`aws-team-roles`, `aws-saml`, `aws-sso`, and `tfstate-backend` components in one large upgrade rather than incrementally.
This will allow you to apply the latest recommended configuration and take advantage of the latest features, including
semi-automatic generation of the AWS config files, and run a single migration of your authentication workflows, rather
than suffer through multiple migrations with customized intermediate configurations.

- Components [version 1.27.0](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/releases/tag/1.27.0)
- Components [PR 438](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/pull/438)
- Required component updates: replace `iam-primary-roles` and `iam-delegated-roles` with `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles`
- Required configuration update complexity: complex, should be handled by Cloud Posse Professional Services
- Forensics: You have this feature if you have `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles` components.

#### Before

Before the development of Atmos, it was difficult to create DRY configurations for IAM roles and policies. The
reference architecture mitigated this for creating the numerous IAM roles and policies needed to support Terraform
and other operations in all the accounts by having a single component, `iam-primary-roles`, do double-duty, both
creating the roles used in the `identity` account and creating templates for the roles used in the other accounts.
Other accounts deployed the `iam-delegated-roles` component and only had to configure deviations from the templates.

This was incredibly confusing to configure properly and was a constant source of errors. It also made it difficult
to add new roles to a subset of accounts, or to integrate with AWS SSO permission sets.

Additionally, access to the Terraform backend was via a role provisioned by the `iam-delegated-roles` component
in the `root` account, which caused 2 problems:

- The role was not available until after the `iam-delegated-roles` component was deployed, which meant that
  components that needed to be deployed before the `iam-delegated-roles` component could not use the Terraform
  backend role, and had to be provisioned by SuperAdmin and _only_ SuperAdmin.
- The role for accessing the Terraform backend was the standard `root-terraform` delegated role with modified,
  very limited permissions, which meant that to actually run Terraform, you had to use a different role
  (the `admin` role) which had full permissions. This exception to the rule of which role Terraform would assume
  to perform updates contributed to confusion and misunderstanding about who could do what, and how.

#### After

The conceptual framework of access control has been clarified, and with the support of Atmos, simplified while
remaining DRY. Also, by the time you get to version 1.238.0, it is well integrated with AWS SSO permission sets.

The `aws-teams` component is deployed to the `identity` account to create what we refer to as "Teams", which
are analogous to "groups" in a traditional access control system. Users are assigned to one or more Teams
via the Identity Provider (usually Okta or Google Workspaces, and possibly via the Identity Provider's "group"
mechanism). Each Team has access to a collection of "Team Roles" (standardized AWS IAM Roles deployed by the
`aws-team-roles` component) in a collection of AWS accounts (including possibly all accounts).

All teams and team roles configure their own permissions and what other principals can assume them. Teams and
AWS SSO Permission sets can be configured as principals allowed to assume the roles using symbolic names. Other
principals can be configured using ARNs. Inheritance and DRY is provided via Atmos stacks.

As of version 1.242.0, the wart of using the `root-terraform` role to access the Terraform backend has been removed,
and the `terraform` role is now used consistently in all accounts. The `tfstate-backend` component is now used to
create the Terraform backend role, now called `tfstate`, and it is available as soon as the Terraform state backend is
created, which is the first step in the Terraform process, and means it is available to SuperAdmin for all subsequent
steps, which means that all the components can be configured to use it, which means normal Terraform users can
manage nearly all components.
