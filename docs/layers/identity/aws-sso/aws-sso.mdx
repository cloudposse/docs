<Intro>
This guide provides an overview of setting up AWS Identity Center (SSO) with ClickOps, detailing prerequisites and supported external identity providers. It explains how to integrate AWS SSO with providers like Azure AD, JumpCloud, Okta, and Google Workspace, including specific steps for configuring each.
</Intro>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  1. Go to the root admin account
  2. Select primary region
  3. Go to AWS SSO
  4. Enable AWS SSO
</Steps>


## Common Identity Providers

These are the instructions for the most common Identity Providers. For other providers, see the next section.

<DocCardList/>


## Supported External Identity Providers

[Follow the AWS documentation for setting up an IdP integration with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/supported-idps.html). This list includes Azure AD, CyberArk, JumpCloud, Okta, OneLogin, and Ping Identity. For other providers, see the next
section.

:::caution Integrating JumpCloud with AWS IAM Identity Center

The official AWS documentation for setting up JumpCloud with AWS IAM Identity Center is not accurate. Instead, please
refer to the [JumpCloud official documentation](https://jumpcloud.com/support/integrate-with-aws-iam-identity-center)

## Other External Identity Providers

For non-explicitly supported Identity Providers, such as GSuite, set up the app integration with a custom external
identity provider. The steps may be different for each IdP, but the goal is ultimately the same.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Identity account in the AWS Console
  2. On the Dashboard page of the IAM Identity Center console, select Choose your identity source
  3. In the Settings, choose the Identity source tab, select the Actions dropdown in the top right, and then select Change
    identity source
  4. By default, IAM Identity Center uses its own directory as the IdP. To use another IdP, you have to switch to an
    external identity provider. Select External identity provider from the available identity sources
  5. Configure the custom SAML application with the Service provider metadata generated from your IdP. Follow the next
    steps from your IdP, and then complete this AWS configuration afterwards
  6. Open your chosen IdP
  7. Create a new SSO application
  8. Download the new app's IdP metadata and use this to complete step 5 above
  9. Fill in the Service provider details using the data from IAM Identity Center, and then choose Continue. The mapping
    for the data is as follows:

      ```
      For ACS URL, enter the IAM Identity Center Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.
      For Entity ID, enter the IAM Identity Center issuer URL.
      Leave the Start URL field empty.
      For Name ID format, select EMAIL.
      ```

  10. If required for the IdP, enable the application for all users
  11. Finally, define specific Groups to match the given Group names by the aws-sso component
      (`stacks/catalog/aws-sso.yaml`). In the default catalog, we define four Groups: `DevOps`, `Developers`,
      `BillingAdmin`, and `Everyone`
</Steps>

If set up properly, Users and Groups added to your IdP will automatically populate and update in AWS.

:::caution

GSuite does not automatically sync Users and Groups with AWS Identity Center without additional configuration! If using
GSuite as an IdP, considering deploying the [ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) tool.
