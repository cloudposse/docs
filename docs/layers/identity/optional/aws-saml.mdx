<Intro>
  The AWS SAML component allows you to authenticate with AWS via a federated identity. This is an alternative to using AWS SSO, that provides lower-level control over the authentication process and supports multiple concurrent IdPs, but with more complexity and a reduced user experience.
</Intro>

As an alternative to AWS SSO, the AWS SAML creates an Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate with AWS via a federated
identity. You can use this federated identity to connect directly to a given AWS Team.

# Export an IdP metadata file from the chosen provider.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Export an IdP metadata file from the chosen provider.

    The creation of metadata files will be different for each IdP.

    Here are some example setup references:

      <TabItem value="google" label="Google Workspace">
        <Steps>
          1. Open the [AWS documentation for GSuite](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/setting-up-g-suite-saml-2-0-federation-with-amazon-appstream-2-0/)
          1. Follow Steps 1 through 7. This document refers to Appstream, but the process will be the same for AWS.
          1. Once you have completed the setup, download the metadata file.
        </Steps>

      <TabItem value="okta" label="Okta">

        <Steps>
          1. Create an "Amazon Web Services Account Federation" application in Okta.
          1. Select "SAML 2.0" from the Sign-On Method.
          1. View and download the identity provider (IdP) metadata file.
        </Steps>

        For details, please see the official [Okta documentation](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/DeploymentGuides/AWS/aws-configure-identity-provider.htm)

      <TabItem value="jumpcloud" label="JumpCloud">
       Follow the [JumpCloud documentation](https://support.jumpcloud.com/support/s/article/getting-started-applications-saml-sso2). Once you have completed the setup, download the metadata file.
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="office365" label="Office 365">
        The setup for Office 365 (or AzureAD) has a few issues that we've encountered. Please follow our [documentation on Office 365](/layers/identity/tutorials/how-to-setup-saml-login-to-aws-from-office-365/) to get the metadata file.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Import the metadata file from the chosen provider.

    Download and save the metadata file with the `aws-saml` component directory.

    <Steps>
      1. Place this file inside the `aws-saml` component directory (`components/terraform/aws-saml/`)
      1. The filename should match the variable configured in the `aws-saml` stack catalog (`stacks/catalog/aws-saml.yaml`).
      1. Commit this to version control.
    </Steps>

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="okta" label="Okta">

      Make sure the `var.saml_providers` map key ends with `-okta`. We filter by this suffix to determine whether or not to set up a dedicated user for Okta. This is only necessary for Okta.

      ```yaml
      saml_providers:
        acme-okta: "OktaIDPMetadata-acme.com.xml"
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy the SAML Integration

    Deploy the `aws-saml` component to your Identity account.

    ```bash
    atmos terraform apply aws-saml -s core-gbl-identity
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Complete the Identity Provider (IdP) setup

    If necessary, complete the integration setup in your chosen IdP. This will vary depending on the provider.

        Follow the steps in the [official Okta documentation](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/deploymentguides/aws/aws-configure-aws-app.htm) to complete the setup. Please review the following tips, as we've encountered these issues in the past:

        - Deploying the `aws-saml` component will create an AWS IAM User, which Okta will be used to discover roles in AWS. This user's access key and secret key are stored in AWS SSM Parameter Store in the same account and (default) region as the `aws-saml` component. This is unique for Okta.
        - In the "Provisioning" tab for the integration in Okta, you must check the **"Update User Attributes"** box. This does not appear in documentation but is necessary for the roles to populate in Okta.

    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> (Optional) Use AWS Extend Switch Roles Browser Extension

    We suggest using the AWS Extend Switch Roles browser extension to simplify role-switching in the AWS Console. This is optional but particularly helpful if youâ€™re not using AWS IAM Identity Center.

    Please see the [AWS Extend Switch Roles plugin](https://github.com/tilfinltd/aws-extend-switch-roles).

    Once you've downloaded the plugin, take the aws-config file from within the `rootfs/etc/aws-config` directory in your infrastructure repository. Paste this into the AWS Extend Switch Roles plugin configuration.
