This documentation describes using **Leapp** for AWS authentication, which is being replaced by **Atmos Auth**.

**The recommended approach now uses:**
- **Atmos Auth** for AWS authentication via `atmos auth login`
- **Atmos Profiles** for role selection (superadmin, managers, devops, developers, github-plan, github-apply)
- **AWS IAM Identity Center** with Permission Sets for access control

See [How to Log into AWS](/layers/identity/how-to-log-into-aws) for updated authentication instructions.

Learn how to use Leapp to supply AWS credentials to tools used within Geodesic.

## Problem

Your company uses AWS SSO, AWS Federated IAM, or AWS IAM Users and you need to login to AWS. Tools like `saml2aws` offer
inconsistent login experiences depending on the SSO provider. You’re a developer and would like to keep your session
active during your working day without constantly re-entering your MFA token or running cumbersome command-line tools.

## Solution

:::

In this how-to, we will help you get started using Geodesic to work with AWS resources by helping you set up and use
[Leapp](https://leapp.cloud/) to handle credentials and authentication. Leapp is an open-source tool that makes this
easier.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Leapp CLI from [https://www.leapp.cloud/releases](https://www.leapp.cloud/releases)

2. Install the AWS CLI (e.g. `brew install awscli`); afterwards, you may need to symlink your homebrew AWS CLI
   installation to `/usr/local/bin` by running: `ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/aws /usr/local/bin/`

3. Install the AWS Session Manager Plugin, see
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)

We expect you’ve gone through our guide on [Geodesic](/resources/legacy/fundamentals/geodesic) prior to using Leapp since that contains
some important understanding of what Geodesic is, how it works, and what it’s doing.

Your organization is already set up with either the [sso](/components/library/aws/identity-center/) or the
[iam-primary-roles](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/deprecated/iam-primary-roles) and
[iam-delegated-roles](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/deprecated/iam-delegated-roles)
components.

#### AWS Region

It will be helpful to know which AWS Region you will be primarily working in. This should be fairly common knowledge
among people with AWS access at your company and documented as part of the ADR for
[Decide on Primary AWS Region](/layers/network/design-decisions/decide-on-primary-aws-region).
If you are doing this on your own, choose the region closest to you geographically. If you are still in doubt, pick

- `ca-central-1` if in Canada,

- `us-east-2` if in the United States east of the Mississippi,

- `us-west-2` if anywhere else in North America or anywhere in Central America,

- `sa-east-1` if in South America,

- `eu-north-1` if in Europe,

- `af-south-1` if in Africa,

- `ap-south-1` if in Asia, or

- `ap-southeast-2` if in Australia or Antarctica.

#### Credentials

You will have to have some way of authenticating to AWS already set up, and you need to know the nature of your
credentials. Whoever gave you access to AWS should be able to tell you what kind of access you have. It should be one of
the following:

- **Federated Role** (recommended). This means you log into something you use to identify yourself to a lot of places
  (usually referred to as Single Sign-On or SSO), and it is set up to log you into AWS with a specific IAM Role as well.
  At a company, this is usually Google Workspaces (formerly GSuite), Okta, or Active Directory. This is also known as a
  SAML IdP.

- **AWS SSO**. This means your company has configured AWS as a Single Sign-On provider. This is AWS _as_ a Single
  Sign-On provider, allowing you to access multiple _permission sets_ within AWS, not using some other Single Sign-On
  provider to sign in to AWS as a single IAM Role. Please note that even if your company has set up AWS _as_ a Single
  Sign-On provider, you still may be using your company’s primary SSO provider to authenticate to AWS SSO.

- **AWS IAM User**. This is the older way of authenticating to AWS, with a basic username and password to log into the
  AWS console and a long-lived “Access Key” for API access. If you are going to use this method, we strongly recommend
  that you enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Based on which kind of credentials you have, you will need to gather different information with which to configure
Leapp. Whoever is in charge of setting up your access to AWS should be able to give you the information you need.

##### Federated Role

If using Federated Login, you will need

- Your IdP Single Sign-On URL.

- For Google Workspaces, it looks something like
  `https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/initsso?idpid=C0asdfasdfal&spid=12344321`.

- For Okta, it looks something like `https://company.okta.com/app/company_samlidp_1/Hka1abcke6h4P1WQr5d7/sso/saml`.

- Most importantly,it should not be confused with the AWS Single Sign-On URLs like these (**do not use these**)

- `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml` (this is used by your IdP admin)

- `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start` (this means you are using AWS SSO)

- The AWS Identity Provider ARN is assigned by AWS to your IdP. Something like

- `arn:aws:iam::123434211234:saml-provider/company-name`

- Your assigned/authorized AWS IAM Role ARN. Something like

- `arn:aws:iam::123434211234:role/role-name`

##### AWS SSO

If using AWS SSO, you will need:

- Your AWS SSO “start URL”, also known as your “portal URL”. It should be very close to:

- `https://something.awsapps.com/start`

- The region in which AWS SSO has been deployed. This may or may not be the same region you will be working in.

##### AWS IAM User

If you are a regular IAM User who can log into the AWS Console, you should log into the AWS Console while setting up
Leapp. Choose “My Security Credentials” from the Account drop-down menu:

- Copy and paste your MFA ARN or Serial Number from the “Assigned MFA device”

- Click on “Create access key” to create a new access key and copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from the
  console and paste directly into the appropriate fields in Leapp.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Start Geodesic

If you are a Cloud Posse client, you will have a customized version of Geodesic that sets an initial value for the
environment variable `AWS_PROFILE`. Alternatively, you may have customized it yourself, or you may want to. In any case,
we will go with what you have. So start Geodesic, and at the command prompt, type

```
echo $AWS_PROFILE
```

This is the value you will give to the profile in Leapp when you configure it. If the output of `echo` is blank, as
would be expected if you are running our public tutorial image, use “default” for the profile name.

Verify you do not have any credentials set via your environment variables. The following command should have no output:

```
declare -p | grep -E '(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY|AWS_SESSION_TOKEN)='
```

If any values are output by the `declare -p | grep...` command, you need to find a way to prevent those environment
variables from being set when you start Geodesic. Most likely they were set via some customization you have installed,
or by running something like `aws-vault`. Fix this before going forward, as having those environment variables set will
prevent Leapp from being effective.

#### Install Leapp

Please refer to the official Leapp documentation for the latest instructions on installing and configuring Leapp. Now
that you are armed with the information from the previous steps, it should be pretty easy.

- Visit the [Leapp website](https://leapp.cloud/)

- Download and install Leapp as instructed by the website

- If using homebrew, you can `brew install --cask leapp`

- Follow the instructions (under “Docs”) for configuring AWS

#### Configure Leapp using the cli

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noovolari/leapp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noovolari/leapp-cli)

`brew install Noovolari/brew/leapp-cli`

Setup some environment variables, use your `LEAPP_IDP_URL` and

```
# your IDP URL by right clicking on the Google AWS icon and clicking "Copy Link"
export LEAPP_IDP_URL="https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/initsso?idpid=snip&spid=snip&forceauthn=false"
export LEAPP_IDP_ARN="arn:aws:iam::1234567890:saml-provider/identity"
export LEAPP_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/identity"
export LEAPP_PROFILE_NAME="my-identity-profile"
export LEAPP_PROFILE_ALIAS="my-profile-alias"
export LEAPP_REGION="us-east-2"
```

Create the idp url only once

```
✗ leapp idp-url create --idpUrl $LEAPP_IDP_URL
identity provider URL created
```

For each customer

```
✗ leapp profile create --profileName $LEAPP_PROFILE_NAME \
  && leapp session add \
    --providerType "aws" \
    --sessionType "awsIamRoleFederated" \
    --sessionName $LEAPP_PROFILE_ALIAS \
    --roleSessionName $LEAPP_PROFILE_ALIAS \
    --region $LEAPP_REGION \
    --roleArn $LEAPP_ROLE_ARN  \
    --idpUrl $LEAPP_IDP_URL \
    --idpArn $LEAPP_IDP_ARN \
    --profileId $(leapp profile list -x | grep $LEAPP_PROFILE_NAME | awk '{ print $1 }' | head -1)
profile created
session added
✗ LEAPP_SESSION_ID=$(leapp session list -x --csv | grep $LEAPP_PROFILE_ALIAS | cut -d',' -f1)
✗ leapp session start --sessionId $LEAPP_SESSION_ID
session started
```

#### Configure Leapp using the app

Below is some guidance to the Leapp documentation that applies as of the time of this writing. By the time you read this
it may be out of date, but hopefully will still be of help in guiding you through the Leapp site.

<img src="/assets/refarch/image-20211027-143855.png" /><br/>

- The “AWS Profile” setting in Leapp must match _exactly_ the value of `$AWS_PROFILE` you found in Geodesic in the
  earlier step.

- The “AWS Region” you set in the Leapp session should be the AWS Region you most often use, as discussed
  [above](/resources/legacy/howto/geodesic/authenticate-with-leapp#aws-region-and-credentials).

- The “Session Alias” is completely up to you: it is the name for this set of credentials that you will see in the UI.

The Leapp documentation is at [https://docs.leapp.cloud/](https://docs.leapp.cloud/) and the best set of instructions to
follow are the ones under a sub-menu on the left side of the page: **Tutorials > AWS**

- If you have a **Federated Login**, pick “AWS IAM Federated Role”. Most of the tutorial is about how to configure
  Federated Login itself, and you can skip all that. Just follow the last step: “Setup in Leapp”.

- Otherwise, pick “AWS SSO” or “AWS IAM User” and follow the steps.

#### Log in Using Leapp

Leapp provides two UIs for logging into or out of a session. There is a system-wide menu item in the taskbar on Windows
systems or as a “status menu” on the Mac menu bar. Click on it and a menu will appear with all your configured session
names and their corresponding profile names. An icon for each session will appear either in gray if logged out or orange
if logged in (at least those are the current defaults for the “Light” color scheme on macOS). Just select the menu item
to toggle the state.

<img src="/assets/refarch/image-20211027-144503.png" /><br/>

Alternately, you can select “Show” from the menu and be shown a richer UI where you can do more, but still, the main
thing is that you click on a session name to change its state and the indicator shows gray for logged out and orange for
logged in.

If you are not using IAM user access keys then in order to access AWS you will have to log in to your “identity
provider” (e.g. Okta, Google) like you do for access to other resources. Therefore, when you try to activate a session
in Leapp, it may open a small web browser window popup or open a window or tab in your default browser so you can
complete the login flow, including supplying a second factor if you are using MFA, and perhaps solving a CAPTCHA puzzle.
This is normal and expected behavior, not a virus or hacking attempt. When you finish logging in via the web browser,
Leapp uses the credentials provided by your identity provider to authenticate to AWS, just as if you were logging into
the AWS web console or SSO portal.

Like your web browser, Leapp can store cookies and other information, and in addition, Leapp is able to use your system
keychain for secure storage of other things like your Secret Access Key. Because of this, and depending on your identity
provider and their settings, simply being logged into your computer may be enough authentication for Leapp to grant you
access when you enable a session without asking you for anything. However, AWS requires periodic refreshing of session
keys and if you are using MFA with AWS, you should enable Leapp notifications so you can receive prompts when your AWS
session expires and Leapp needs a new MFA token in order to start a new session for you.

#### It Should “Just Work”

Once you log in to AWS using Leapp, go back into Geodesic and simply hit return at the prompt. The prompt should change
from having a red ✗ and `[none]` to having a green √ and `[default]` or whatever your profile name is. This is
Geodesic’s way of letting you know you are authorized with AWS, and what profile you have active.

You can always confirm your current authentication status by running:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

When you are properly authenticated, it will output your IAM role and other information. When you are logged out, it
will print some kind of error message, usually:

```
Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
```

### FAQ

#### “Named Profile” does not show my profile in the dropdown

Click the box under “Named Profile” and start typing to add a new list item. Your text should replace what is in the
box, i.e. “default”, and you will get an option to add a new list item.

#### Getting Leapp integrated with Windows

This presents a unique challenge as `docker` does not understand Windows block devices. If you try to simply mount the
`.aws` from your Windows-native Leapp into a Geodesic container, the volume mount will fail to follow a symlink. It also
will not share the Windows device.

To get around this, there are two options:

1. Set up a cronjob that regularly syncs the `.aws` directory from your Windows native Leapp into your WSL2 home
   directory. This is the easiest option, but it means you'll have to wait for a few seconds depending on how often you
   run the cronjob.
2. Set up a FIFO pipe using `mkfifo` that will allow you to stream the output of `leapp` into the `.aws/credentials`
   file. If your `.aws/config` changes a lot, you'd also need a separate file. This is the more complicated option, but
   you can run `leapp` and have it immediately available in your Geodesic container. A simple example follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkfifo ~/.aws/credentials
(while :; do cat /mnt/c/Users/<username>/.aws/credentials > ~/.aws/credentials; done) &
```

Because there has to be a reader in order to write, the while loop will block until something tries to read from the
pipe. At worst, you may need to enter Geodesic twice to ensure the latest credentials are used.

NOTE: This is just a mundane script. Sophistication can be added to support closing the pipe on exit, detecting if the
pipe is already open, etc.
