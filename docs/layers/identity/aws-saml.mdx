As an alternative to AWS SSO, the AWS SAML creates an Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate with AWS via a federated
identity. You can use this federated identity to connect directly to a given AWS Team.

## Setting up IdP Metadata for SAML

Export an Identity Provider (IdP) metadata file from the chosen provider. You'll need to place this file inside the
`aws-saml` component directory (`components/terraform/aws-saml/`) and commit this to version control. The filename
should match the variable configured in `stacks/catalog/aws-saml.yaml`.

The creation of these metadata files will be different for each IdP. Here are some example setup references:
