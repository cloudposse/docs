description: Determine the teams that will be responsible for incidents
---

## Problem
Teams need to be notified of incidents tied to services that affect them.

## Solution
Come up with a table of services and the teams or business units responsible for them.

Services are associated with incidents

Incidents are escalated to teams

## Other Considerations
- Should the teams map to products, services or business units?

- Should we map the teams to existing teams in IdP or directly associate users to teams in OpsGenie?

#### **Hereâ€™s how we think about teams:**

:::note
NOTE: members can also be handled by the IdP integration, but the teams still need to be defined in OpsGenie)
