<Intro>
Setting up rotations in OpsGenie ensures that on-call schedules are managed effectively, allowing team members to rotate between on-call and off-call periods. This guide will show you how to configure on-call rotations through the OpsGenie UI, enabling seamless schedule management without the need for GitOps.
</Intro>

## Problem

You need to configure rotations to allow people to be on call for periods of time before rotating to off-call and having someone else cover.

## Solution

:::tip
This is done through the UI, because typically managers move schedules around and using GitOps is overkill.

:::

This is done through ClickOps by going to:

**Teams** → My-Team → On-Call → **On-call schedules** → + Add Rotations.

Fill this out with the information of whose on call when!
