# How to Setup Rotations in OpsGenie

## Problem
You need to configure rotations to allow people to be on call for periods of time before rotating to off-call and having someone else cover.

## Solution

:::tip
This is done through the UI, because typically managers move schedules around and using GitOps is overkill.

:::

This is done through ClickOps by going to:
**Teams** → My-Team → On-Call → **On-call schedules** → + Add Rotations.

Fill this out with the information of whose on call when!
