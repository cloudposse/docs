<Intro>
  With so many moving pieces, it's crucial to monitor what's happening under the hood to understand what's going on. This includes gathering telemetry, in the form of metrics and logs coming from your services and the underlying infrastructure. This data must be shipped somewhere to build dashboards and raise alerts that will escalate to the appropriate personnel. Depending on your business needs, you may also need to monitor for security and compliance against various technical benchmarks like PCI/DSS, CIS, ISO 27001, and others.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Set up Telemetry

    Choose between Datadog or AWS-managed Prometheus and Grafana with Loki for gathering your telemetry.

    Datadog offers the most mature implementation, while AWS-managed Grafana and Prometheus provide lower-cost alternatives with various trade-offs, that make them a good fit for many organizations.

    ## <StepNumber/> Manage Incidents

    With monitoring in place and alerts being emitted, itâ€™s crucial to define what qualifies as an incident and escalate it to the appropriate people for action. We support OpsGenie, which will be natively integrated with Datadog.
