# Decide on SFTP Requirements

## Problem **DRAFT**

## Context

## Considered Options

- Will SFTP access the existing buckets? or do we need to create a new bucket?

- Do you need different users with different levels of access?

- Will users need to be to be restricted to different paths of the SFTP file system?

- Will the service need to be able to accept multiple logins?

- Will the service be public (0.0.0.0/0) or only available to certain CIDRs?

- What are the logging requirements?

- What are the object lifecycle requirements?

- What type of authentication is needed? e.g. Basic certificate-based or SAML?
