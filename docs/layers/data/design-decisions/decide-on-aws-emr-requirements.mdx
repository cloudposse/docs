## Problem

We need to document the requirements for the EMR cluster.

## Context

If EMR is presently deployed, the best course of action is to replicate the settings you have (share these details if thatâ€™s the case).

## Considered Options

A list of applications for the cluster. Currently supported options are: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, JupyterHub, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, TensorFlow, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper (as of EMR 5.25.0).

For a full list of supported options, review the EMR module.
