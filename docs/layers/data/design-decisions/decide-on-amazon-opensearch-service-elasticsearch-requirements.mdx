## Problem

Requirements for the Amazon OpenSearch Service ([formerly known as Elasticsearch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elasticsearch-service-is-now-amazon-opensearch-service-and-supports-opensearch-10/)) clusters deployed to each active compute environment need to be outlined before an Elasticsearch component is configured and deployed

## Context

At a minimum, we need the following for each operating stage (prod, staging, dev, etc)

- Instance family for each node

- Number of nodes

- EBS volume size

- Whether or not Kibana is required

See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/sizing-domains.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/sizing-domains.html) for Amazon’s recommendations.

## Considered Options

Create a standardized Elasticsearch (Amazon OpenSearch Service) cluster based on one of these options. We’ll also need to know how these requirements will vary by stage.

:::caution
This is a reversible decision, however, resizing large OpenSearch clusters can literally take several days.

:::

### Option 1: Use Current Infrastructure Requirements

:::info
If already opening OpenSearch, we recommend sharing a screenshot of your current setup from the AWS web console for each cluster in every environment.

:::

### Option 2: Use Minimal Elasticsearch (Amazon OpenSearch) Cluster Requirements

Because the [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/sizing-domains.html) recommends having at least 3 nodes in each Elasticsearch cluster in order to avoid a split-brain scenario, each cluster should contain 3 nodes (if it were to be minimally sized).

This, in addition to the requirements outlined in _v1 Infrastructure Requirements_, concludes that each Elasticsearch
cluster will have the following requirements:

| **Requirement**               | **Recommendation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                            |

## Consequences

Provision Amazon OpenSearch Service based on these requirements using the `elasticsearch` component with terraform.

- This allows for a standardized Elasticsearch cluster that satisfies the requirements required by the application stack
  in each active compute environment.

- This standard size can be easily adjusted as needed, so this is an easily reversible decision.
