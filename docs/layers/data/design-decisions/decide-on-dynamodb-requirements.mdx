# Decide on DynamoDB Requirements

## Problem **DRAFT**
Requirements for DynamoDB tables deployed to each active compute environment need to be outlined before a DynamoDB component is configured and deployed.

## Context
We need to at a minimum define the following requirements:

- Read/Write capacity Mode (and related settings)

- Integrated backup settings:

- Point-in-time-recovery (PITR) or on-demand

- AWS Backup settings:

- Backup frequency

- Backup lifecycle

- TTL (whether or not to enable)

## Considered Options

Create a standardized DynamoDB Table based on the current use case:

### v1 Infrastructure Requirements

Currently, DynamoDB tables are used within [CHANGE ME].

DynamoDB tables use `PAY_PER_REQUEST` billing instead of `PROVISIONED` billing because:

- The DynamoDB is part of a data pipeline where the table IO operations are not entirely predictable, therefore realized
throughput may be significantly below or above the provisioned throughput throughout the day.

- The DynamoDB table IO operations are also not entirely consistent, therefore a provisioned capacity table whose
realized throughput closely meets its provisioned throughput cover a period of one day may not do so the next day.

- If the provisioned capacity tables surpass their provisioned throughput, throttling will occur, unless auto-scaling is
implemented for the DynamoDB table. This involves more machinery and is only warranted for DynamoDB tables whose
realized throughput is very close to their provisioned throughput, and which need to be able to handle unpredictable
spikes from time-to-time. This is not cost-effective for a table whose realized throughput does not meet its
provisioned throughput consistently in the first place.

- Due to the reasons described above, it is more cost-effective to [CHANGE ME: PAY_PER_REQUEST OR PROVISIONED]

Backups (both integrated and via AWS Backup) are configured for DynamoDB as follows:

- Integrated Backup type: in production, the DynamoDB tables have integrated point-in-time-recovery (PITR) backups which
allow for a to-the-second recovery. The retention period is the maximum PITR retention period, which is 35 days. For
non-production environments, PITR is disabled. Integrated on-demand backups are not used, because AWS Backup performs
the same function. Enabling integrated PITR backups alongside AWS Backup allows for the "best of both worlds" for
DynamoDB backups â€” that is, the ability to restore to the second for the past 35 days, and to have periodic snapshots
for a long period of time.

- AWS Backup is disabled for non-production environments.

- AWS Backup frequency: the DynamoDB tables are backed up once a month. For simplicity, this is the first day of the
month.

- AWS Backup lifecycle: the DynamoDB tables backups are transitioned to cold storage after some time and are eventually
deleted. The backup is moved to cold storage after [CHANGE ME] days, and is deleted after [CHANGE ME] days. This leaves a short period
in the month to restore the table from warm storage, and exactly 3 months in cold storage to recover the table.

[TALK ABOUT WHETHER TTL IS GOING TO BE USED]

### Standardized DynamoDB Table Requirements

The requirements outlined by _v1 Infrastructure Requirements_ are sufficiently comprehensive to be standardized in the
v2 infrastructure:

- Read/Write capacity Mode: `[CHANGE ME]`

- PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled: `true` for production, `false` for non-production environments

- AWS Backup settings (disabled for non-production environments):

- BackupCronExpression: `[CHANGE ME]`

- DeleteAfterDays: `[CHANGE ME]`

- MoveToColdStorageAfterDays: `[CHANGE ME]`

- TimeToLiveSpecification:

- Enabled:`false`

## Consequences

Create a DynamoDB component and tune it to the outlined requirements.
