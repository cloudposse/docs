## Considerations

- Global Aurora Postgres cluster requires at least two regions in which `aws_rds_cluster` are created

- An Aurora global database consists of one primary AWS Region where your data is mastered, and up to five read-only, secondary AWS Regions. Aurora replicates data to the secondary AWS Regions with a typical latency of under a second. You issue write operations directly to the primary DB instance in the primary AWS Region

- Related to this: decide on VPC CIDRs for the main and backup regions

:::info
Consequences of deploying RDS Aurora Global Cluster include:

- Provisioning additional VPC and Aurora clusters in the backup region

- Setting up peering via the transit gateway because write operations go directly to the primary DB instance in the primary AWS Region
