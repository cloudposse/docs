<Intro>
  There are many options for provisioning databases in AWS. The reference architecture provides support for a variety of databases, including Aurora PostgreSQL, Aurora MySQL, DynamoDB, RDS, ElastiCache, DocumentDB, and more.

  Each database has its own unique features and benefits, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs or deploy multiple databases to support different use cases.
