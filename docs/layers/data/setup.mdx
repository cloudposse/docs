## Quick Start

| Steps                     | Example                             |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| 1. Vendor data components | `atmos workflow vendor -f data`     |
| 2. Connect to the VPN     | Click Ops                           |
| 3. Deploy clusters        | `atmos workflow deploy/all -f data` |

## Requirements

In order to deploy Data layer components, Networking must be fully deployed and functional. See [the network documentation](/layers/network) for details.

All deployment steps below assume that the environment has been successfully set up with the following steps.

<Steps>
  1. Sign into AWS via Leapp
  2. Connect to the VPN
  3. Open Geodesic
</Steps>

## Supported databases

At the moment we have support for:

- [Aurora PostgreSQL](/components/library/aws/aurora-postgres/)

- [Aurora PostgreSQL Resources](/components/library/aws/aurora-postgres-resources/)

- [Aurora MySQL](/components/library/aws/aurora-mysql/)

- [Aurora MySQL Resources](/components/library/aws/aurora-mysql-resources/)

- [AWS Backup](/components/library/aws/aws-backup/)

- [DocumentDB](/components/library/aws/documentdb/)

- [DynamoDB](/components/library/aws/dynamodb/)

- [Elasticsearch Cluster](/components/library/aws/elasticsearch/)

- [RDS](/components/library/aws/rds/)

- [RedShift](/components/library/aws/redshift/)

- [ElastiCache Redis](/components/library/aws/elasticache-redis/) ### Vendor

Vendor all data components with the following workflow:

```bash
atmos workflow vendor -f data
```

These run several vendor commands for each included component. You can always run these commands individually to update
any single component. For example:

> Note: We're using `aurora-postgres` for this example. Your database selection may differ.

```bash
atmos vendor pull -c aurora-postgres
```

### Deploy

In order to deploy database, deploy both the cluster and the resources component (if applicable). Applying changes to
the resources component requires a VPN connection. For example,

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/all -f data
```
