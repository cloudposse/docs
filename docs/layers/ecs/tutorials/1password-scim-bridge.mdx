<Intro>
  The 1Password SCIM Bridge is a service that allows you to automate the management of users and groups in 1Password. This guide will walk you through deploying the SCIM Bridge for ECS environments.
</Intro>

## Implementation

The implementation of this is fairly simple. We will generate credentials for the SCIM bridge in 1Password, store them in AWS SSM Parameter Store, deploy the SCIM bridge ECS service, and then finally connect your choosen identity provider.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Generate Credentials for your SCIM bridge in 1Password

    The first step is to generate credentials for your SCIM bridge in 1Password. We will pass these credentials to Terraform and the ECS task definition to create the SCIM bridge.

    <Steps>
      1. Log in to your 1Password account
      1. Click Integrations in the sidebar.
      1. Choose your identity provider from the User Provisioning section.
      1. Follow the onscreen instructions to generate the Bearer Token for your SCIM bridge.
      1. Store the credentials in AWS SSM Parameter Store.

        <Steps>
          - Open the AWS Web Console - Navigate to the target account, such as `plat-dev`, and target region, such as `us-west-2`
          - Open "AWS System Manager" > "Parameter Store"
          - Create a new Secure String parameter using the credentials you generated in the previous step: `/1password/scim/bearer-token`
        </Steps>
    </Steps>

    There will be additional steps to complete the integration in 1Password, but first we need to deploy the SCIM bridge service.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber /> Deploy the SCIM bridge ECS Service

    The next step is to deploy the SCIM bridge ECS service. We will use Terraform to create the necessary resources with our existing `ecs-service` component. Ensure you have the `ecs-service` component and `ecs` cluster before proceeding.

    If you do not have ECS prerequisites, please see the [ECS layer](/layers/ecs) to create the necessary resources.

    <Steps>
      1. Create a new stack configuration for the SCIM bridge. The placement of this file will depend on your project structure. For example, you could create a new file such as `stacks/catalog/ecs-services/1password-scim-bridge.yaml` with the following content:

          <CollapsibleText type="medium">
          ```yaml
          import:
            - catalog/terraform/services/defaults

          components:
            terraform:
              1pass-scim:
                metadata:
                  component: ecs-service
                  inherits:
                    - ecs-service/defaults
                vars:
                  enabled: true
                  name: 1pass-scim
                  containers:
                    service:
                      name: op_scim_bridge
                      image: 1password/scim:v2.9.5
                      cpu: 128
                      memory: 512
                      essential: true
                      dependsOn:
                        - containerName: redis
                          condition: START
                      port_mappings:
                        - containerPort: 3002
                          hostPort: 3002
                          protocol: tcp
                      map_environment:
                        OP_REDIS_URL: redis://localhost:6379
                        OP_TLS_DOMAIN: ""
                        OP_CONFIRMATION_INTERVAL: "300"
                      map_secrets:
                        OP_SESSION: "1password/scim/bearer-token"
                        # OP_WORKSPACE_CREDENTIALS: ""
                        # OP_WORKSPACE_SETTINGS: ""
                      log_configuration:
                        logDriver: awslogs
                        options: {}
                    redis:
                      name: redis
                      image: redis:latest
                      cpu: 128
                      memory: 512
                      essential: true
                      restart: always
                      port_mappings:
                        - containerPort: 6379
                          hostPort: 6379
                          protocol: tcp
                      map_environment:
                        REDIS_ARGS: "--maxmemory 256mb --maxmemory-policy volatile-lru"
                      log_configuration:
                        logDriver: awslogs
                        options: {}
          ```
          </CollapsibleText>
      2. Confirm the `map_secrets` value for `OP_SESSION` matches the AWS SSM Parameter Store path you created previously, an confirm they are in the same account and region as this ECS service component.
      3. Deploy the ECS service with Atmos:
         ```bash
         atmos terraform apply 1pass-scim -s plat-usw2-dev
         ```
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### <StepNumber/> Validate the Integration

  After the task is deployed, validate the integration. Connect to the VPN (if deployed the ECS service is deployed with a private ALB), navigate to the SCIM bridge URL, and confirm the service is running.

  For example, go to `https://1pass-scim.platform.usw1.dev.plat.acme-svc.com/`
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### <StepNumber/> Connect your Identity Provider

  Finally, connect your identity provider to the SCIM bridge. The SCIM bridge URL will be the URL you validated in the previous step. Follow the instructions in the 1Password SCIM Bridge documentation to connect your identity provider.

  </Step>
