## Context and Problem Statement

Should logs be sent to datadog or log only to cloudwatch logs?

## Considered Options

<Tabs queryString="option">

  <TabItem label="Option 1" value="option-1">
    ### Option 1. Fluent Bit sidecar is required for ECS Fargate

    > In addition to your application container, your task definition needs to specify a Fluent Bit sidecar container that’s
    > responsible for routing logs to Datadog. AWS provides an `aws-for-fluent-bit` Docker image you can use to create the
    > sidecar container.([source](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/aws-fargate-monitoring-with-datadog/))

    #### Pros

    - Recommended by Datadog

    - Works without much configuration

    - Prior art for this

    #### Cons

    - Sidecar required

    - Fargate cpu/mem requirements would go up per task

    - More expensive due to fargate pricing is by cpu/memory

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Option 2" value="option-2">
    ### Option 2. Datadog Lambda Forwarder

    Apps log directly to cloudwatch log groups and the Datadog lambda forwarder would then forwards the logs

    [https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/tree/master/aws/logs_monitoring](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/tree/master/aws/logs_monitoring)

    And we have a module for this

    [https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-datadog-lambda-forwarder](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-datadog-lambda-forwarder)

    #### Pros

    - Apps log to cloudwatch log groups

    - if logging to a single log group per account, we can use `filter_patterns` to filter the events

    - if logging to a log group per service, we can give it multiple cloudwatch log group names or deploy a separate lambda
      per service

    - Module exposes providing your own lambda in case forking the official Datadog one is needed

    - Prior art for this

    #### Cons

    - Previously recommended by Datadog

    - Need to log to cloudwatch logs before pushing to Datadog

    - Maintaining upgrades for the lambdas

    - Monitoring lambdas

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Option 3" value="option-3">

    ### Option 3. Fluentd with CloudWatch Plugin

    In the future, if AWS adds a logdriver for `fluentd` without firelens (like with `splunk`), then we can forward to a
    fluentd aggregator without a sidecar and without logging to cloudwatch.

    We could create a single service in each ecs cluster to run fluentd and the cloudwatch plugin would be able to push
    cloudwatch logs to datadog.

    [https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/)

    [https://github.com/fluent-plugins-nursery/fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs#in_cloudwatch_logs](https://github.com/fluent-plugins-nursery/fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs#in_cloudwatch_logs)

    #### Pros

    - More control over parsing logs

    - Can output to multiple SIEMs

    #### Cons

    - Same cons as option 1

    - Maintaining a fluentd cluster

    - Monitoring a fluentd cluster

    - We don’t have prior art for this.
