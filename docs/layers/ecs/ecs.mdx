Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully-managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. ECS makes it easy to run and manage Docker containers on AWS infrastructure, providing a secure and scalable platform for your applications.

## The Problem

The emergence of Docker necessitated the development of container management solutions, with Kubernetes being one of the most widely adopted options. However, Kubernetes is often considered overly complex for smaller scale operations, akin to using a nuclear reactor to charge a phone. In such scenarios, Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a more practical choice for deploying applications with speed and efficiency.

With ECS there is no need to upgrade the underlying platform. Unlike EKS which requires consistent upgrades to stay
current, ECS is a managed service that is always up to date. This means that you can focus on your application and not the underlying platform.

## Our Solution

We have developed a set of Terraform modules that can be used to deploy ECS clusters and services.

### ECS Cluster Component

The [`ecs` component] is used to deploy an ECS cluster and an associated load balancer.

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Through stack configuration you can determine your domains, subdomains, and the number of instances to deploy. The component also supports the deployment of a bastion host, which can be used to access containers on the ECS Cluster.

```yaml
alb_configuration:
  public: # name of the ALB to be referred to by other configurations
    internal_enabled: false # sets it to public
    # resolves to *.public-platform.<environment>.<stage>.<tenant>.<domain>.<tld>
    route53_record_name: "*.public-platform"
  private:
    internal_enabled: true
    route53_record_name: "*.private-platform"
```

#### Autoscaling

The cluster component has the ability to scale with a variety of options. Fargate provides a serverless way of scaling. Spot instances provide a cheaper way to run instances than on demand ec2. you can mix these options to provide a cost effective and scalable solution.

```yaml
name: ecs
capacity_providers_fargate: true
capacity_providers_fargate_spot: true
capacity_providers_ec2:
  default:
    instance_type: t3.medium
    max_size: 2
```

### ECS Service

The [`ecs-service` component] is used to deploy an ECS service. This includes the task and the service definition.

By default we also support datadog logging and metrics. This can be disabled by setting `datadog_agent_sidecar_enabled` to false.

```yaml
datadog_agent_sidecar_enabled: false
```

## FAQ

### How do I add a new service to an existing ECS cluster?

Add a new instance of the `ecs-service` component to your stack configuration. The component will automatically detect the ECS cluster and add the service to it.

### How can I add AWS Policies to my ECS Tasks?

Use the `task_policy_arns` to attach policies to individual tasks, this allows those tasks to access AWS resources.

```yaml
task_policy_arns:
  - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
```

### How can I inject secrets into my ECS Service?

Use the `map_secrets` variable which maps a environment variable key to an SSM param store key. This will inject the value of the SSM param store key into the environment variable.

```yaml
map_secrets:
  SECRET_KEY: /my/secret/key
```

### How can we create Self Hosted Runners for GitHub with ECS?

If we are not deploying EKS for our platform, it doesnt make much sense to configure EKS solely for self-hosted runners. Instead we deploy an EC2 Autoscaling Group in AWS and connect those instances to GitHub.

For more on GitHub Runners in an ASG, see [`github-runners`](/components/library/aws/github-runners/).
