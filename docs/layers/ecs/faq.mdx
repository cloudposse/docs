Frequently asked questions about ECS with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.

## How do I add a new service to an existing ECS cluster?

Add a new instance of the `ecs-service` component to your stack configuration. The component will automatically detect the ECS cluster and add the service to it.

## How can I add AWS Policies to my ECS Tasks?

Use the `task_policy_arns` to attach policies to individual tasks, this allows those tasks to access AWS resources.

```yaml
task_policy_arns:
  - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
```

## How can I inject secrets into my ECS Service?

Use the `map_secrets` variable which maps a environment variable key to an SSM param store key. This will inject the value of the SSM param store key into the environment variable.

```yaml
map_secrets:
  SECRET_KEY: /my/secret/key
```

## How can we create Self Hosted Runners for GitHub with ECS?

If we are not deploying EKS for our platform, it doesn't make much sense to configure EKS solely for self-hosted runners. Instead, we deploy the [Philips Labs Action Runners](/layers/github-actions/philips-labs-github-runners) and connect those instances to GitHub.

For more on self-hosted GitHub Runners, see [`github-runners`](/layers/github-actions).
