Frequently asked questions about ECS with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.
</Intro>

## How do I add a new service to an existing ECS cluster?

Add a new instance of the `ecs-service` component to your stack configuration. The component will automatically detect the ECS cluster and add the service to it.

## How can I add AWS Policies to my ECS Tasks?

Use the `task_policy_arns` to attach policies to individual tasks, this allows those tasks to access AWS resources.

```yaml
task_policy_arns:
  - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
```

## How can I inject secrets into my ECS Service?

Use the `map_secrets` variable which maps a environment variable key to an SSM param store key. This will inject the value of the SSM param store key into the environment variable.

```yaml
map_secrets:
  SECRET_KEY: /my/secret/key
```

## How can we create Self Hosted Runners for GitHub with ECS?

We recommend [Runs On](/layers/github-actions/runs-on/) for self-hosted GitHub runners. It provides zero infrastructure management, simple setup via GitHub App, and cost-effective pay-per-use pricing without requiring Kubernetes.

For more on self-hosted GitHub Runners, see the [GitHub Actions layer](/layers/github-actions/).
