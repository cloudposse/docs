## Quick Start

| Steps                   | Example                                 |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Vendor ECS components   | `atmos workflow vendor -f ecs`          |
| Deploy ACM certificates | `atmos workflow deploy/ecs-acm -f ecs`  |
| Connect to the VPN      | Click Ops                               |
| Deploy Clusters         | `atmos workflow deploy/clusters -f ecs` |

## Requirements

In order to deploy ECS, Networking must be fully deployed and functional. In particular, the user deploying the cluster must have a working VPN connection to the targeted account. See [the network documentation](/layers/network/) for details.

All deployment steps below assume that the environment has been successfully set up with the following steps.

<Steps>
  1. Sign into AWS via Leapp
  1. Connect to the VPN
  1. Open Geodesic
</Steps>

  # Steps

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Vendor Components

    Vendor these components with the included Atmos Workflows.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="vendor" fileName="ecs" />

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy ECS

    ECS provisioning includes deploying certificate requirements, the default ECS cluster, and Echo Server. Echo Server is a basic service used to validate a successful cluster deployed and is an example of an ECS service. Find ECS Service definitions under `catalog/stacks/ecs-services`.

    To provision each cluster, these components need to be deployed in order. The included Atmos Workflows will carry out this deployment in the proper order, but any of these step can be run outside of a workflow if desired.

    See the ecs workflow (`stacks/workflows/ecs.yaml`) for each individual deployment step.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy ACM Certificates

    First deploy all required ACM certificates for each ECS cluster. These certificates validate the given service domain. You can deploy these certificates before associating the given Route 53 Hosted Zone with the purchased domain in your chosen Domain Registrar, but the certificate will not be ISSUED until the registered domain and Hosted Zone are connected.

    Run the following to deploy every required ACM certificate for ECS.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/ecs-acm" fileName="ecs" />

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Connect to the VPN

    In order to complete the following steps, connect to the VPN now. For more on connecting to the VPN, see
    [`ec2-client-vpn`](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/ec2-client-vpn/#testing).

    The OVPN configuration for your VPN can be found in the output of the `ecs-client-vpn` component. For example,

    ```bash
    atmos terraform output ec2-client-vpn -s core-use1-network
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy All Clusters

    Run the following to deploy every ECS cluster. This workflow will deploy every required platform cluster.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/clusters" fileName="ecs" />

  </Step>
</Steps>
