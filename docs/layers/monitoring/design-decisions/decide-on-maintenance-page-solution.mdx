# Decide on Maintenance Page Solution

## Problem

When your sites go down, we need to be able to communicate more graciously to customers that you’re having issues than a generic “502 Bad Gateway” message.

:::info
Specifically, this decision relates to services behind an ALB. CloudFront and S3 are out of scope.

## Solution

We recommend deploying a static maintenance page. The industry best practice is to host the downtime page on a cloud provider that does not share infrastructure with your primary cloud provider. E.g. S3 is not recommended, as even S3 has gone down.  That said, using a separate cloud provider is a micro-optimization for a very narrow set of failure scenarios.

Some related considerations are how the maintenance page will be activated.

### Considered Options
There are a few options:

### Option 1

Use route53 health checks. Cloud Posse does not recommend it because poorly implemented DNS-clients clients may cache the downtime host.

### Option2

Use CloudFront dynamically redirect to downtime page using an Origin Group with fail-over.

Here’s a simple example using `terraform` to provision a maintenance page on Cloud Flare.

### Option 3 (Recommended)

Use ALB with [fixed response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html#fixed-response-actions)

- Use `fixed-response` with iframe (not ideal) to S3 static site

- Use `fixed-response` populated with HTML from `file` with inline CSS, SVGs, etc. and no external dependencies (if possible)

- Add GA code for analytics
