## Problem

Roles can be used to restrict access to dashboards and monitors.

## Solution

### Option 1: Default Roles  (Recommended)

:::tip
Stick with the Default roles unless you need the granularity

:::
Datadog ships with the standard roles of admin, standard, and read only

### Option 2: Custom Roles

Custom roles give you the ability to define a more granular access model. To enable custom roles, datadog support must be contacted.
