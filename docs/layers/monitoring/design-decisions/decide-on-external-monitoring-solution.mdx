# Decide on External Monitoring Solution

## Problem

Weâ€™ll want some sort of external monitoring solution, ideally provided by an external third-party SaaS.

## Solution

Use a third-party monitoring solution, ideally one that supports more advanced synthetics as well as behind-the-firewall monitoring checks.

:::tip
We recommend you stick with the synthetic monitoring provided by Datadog which supports both public and private endpoints via the private locations.
