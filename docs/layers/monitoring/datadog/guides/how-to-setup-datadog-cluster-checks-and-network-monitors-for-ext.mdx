## Problem

We often want a lightweight way to ensure our endpoints remain healthy. In kubernetes this requires that a loadbalancer be setup with the right annotations and certs to allow traffic to your application. This creates dependencies on cert-manager and other platform tools. The Health Check of a kubernetes app will always use the local IP, which doesnâ€™t really test your networking. We need a way to test that your apps are still ready to receive requests.

## Solution

:::tip
TL;DR Use **Cluster Network Checks** to test your endpoints. These will test external URLs which helps ensure endpoints are healthy.

:::

Cluster Checks are configured on the datadog agent, by specifying agent configuration you can set these checks to run once per cluster instead of once per node agent. These Checks test the validity of externally accessible URLs hosted in Kubernetes.

To get started follow this guide: [https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/cluster_agent/clusterchecks/?tab=helm](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/cluster_agent/clusterchecks/?tab=helm)

For helm that means ensuring the following values are set

```
datadog:
  clusterChecks:
    enabled: true
  # (...)
clusterAgent:
  enabled: true
```

### External URLs

We then need to set particular helm values for each installation of the agent in each cluster. the external URL checks must be written into the agent configuration and cannot be dynamically loaded by annotations.

CloudPosse Datadog Agent now supports **Cluster Checks** this via `this pr`

Upgrade to the latest and add your network checks as yaml. This follows the same configuration as monitors. Where checks are deep merged and templated, they can be configured per environment.

## Datadog Monitors

After your Cluster Checks are setup we need to create monitors for them.

Http check will verify successful HTTP checks on a URL

SSL check will verify the certificate of your URL
