## Problem

Youâ€™ve been asked to sign up for DataDog, but you're not quite sure which plans and features you need.

## Solution

Review the [https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/)

:::tip
We recommend the Enterprise Plan if you will need Custom Roles, otherwise the Pro Plan should suffice.

:::
After signing up, if you require child organizations, make sure to request it be enabled on your account by your Datadog Account Manager.

### Pricing Gotchas

- Commit to a certain number of hosts per month for cheaper pricing

- If using spot instances, you may be charged for multiple hosts. For instance, you may use a spot instance for an EKS node, the node is replaced with another spot instance, and Datadog now charges for 2 hosts instead of 1 host for that month.

### Enterprise Plan

Many features are restricted to Enterprise Plans.

:::caution
Custom Roles are an enterprise only feature. [https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/?tab=datadogapplication#custom-roles](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/?tab=datadogapplication#custom-roles)
