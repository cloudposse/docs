## Context and Problem Statement

Datadog supports log ingestion, but [it can be costly.](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/?product=log-management#log-management) Some companies prefer to use in-place tooling like Splunk or Sumologic instead.

## Considered Options

### Option 1 (Recommended) - Use Datadog

:::tip
Our Recommendation is to use Option 1 because you get a single pane of glass view into all operations

:::

### Option 2 - Other

#### Pros

- Tightly integrated with your existing systems

- Possible lower cost to operate that Datadog

#### Cons

- We cannot assist with the implementation aside from forwarding logs using something like `fluentd` or `fluentbit`
