The Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed service for Grafana used to query, visualize, and alert on your metrics,
logs, and traces. Grafana provides a centralized dashboard where we can add many data sources.

## Deployment

### Collecting Metrics

Once Prometheus is fully functional on its own, then we add the HTTP endpoint for Prometheus as a data source for Amazon
Managed Grafana, where we can centralize, visualize, query, and alert on those metrics. The Prometheus workspace is
fully managed by AWS so therefore is not deployed to an EKS cluster.

Deploy the Amazon Managed Prometheus workspace with the `managed-prometheus/workspace` component to each platform
account and/or any account where you'd like to collect metrics. Define a stack catalog as follows:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    prometheus:
      metadata:
        component: managed-prometheus/workspace
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: prometheus
        # Create cross-account role for core-auto to access AMP
        grafana_account_name: core-auto
```

Then import this stack catalog file anywhere you want to deploy Prometheus. For example, all platform accounts. Then
deploy the workspace into each stack:

```console
atmos terraform apply prometheus -s plat-use2-sandbox
atmos terraform apply prometheus -s plat-use2-dev
atmos terraform apply prometheus -s plat-use2-staging
atmos terraform apply prometheus -s plat-use2-prod
```

Once you have the workspace provisioned, then add a collector. There are a number of collectors that can be set up with
Prometheus, but we primarily use the Amazon managed collector for EKS, commonly referred to as a "scraper". The scraper
is deployed alongside an EKS cluster and is granted permission to read metrics for that EKS cluster. That scraper then
forwards logs to Amazon Managed Prometheus.

Deploy the managed collected with the `eks/prometheus-scraper` component to any account with Prometheus where you'd like
to collect metrics from EKS. Define a stack catalog as follows:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    eks/prometheus-scraper:
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: prometheus-scraper
        prometheus_component_name: prometheus
```

Then import this stack catalog file anywhere you want to deploy Prometheus. For example, all platform accounts. Then
deploy the workspace into each stack:

```console
atmos terraform apply eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use2-sandbox
atmos terraform apply eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use2-dev
atmos terraform apply eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use2-staging
atmos terraform apply eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use2-prod
```

Finally after the scraper is deployed, we have to finish the Cluster Role Binding configuration with the EKS cluster's
auth map. Note the `scraper_role_arn` and `clusterrole_username` outputs from the `eks/prometheus-scraper` component and
set them to `rolearn` and `username` respectively with the `map_additional_iam_roles` input for `eks/cluster`.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    eks/cluster:
      vars:
        map_additional_iam_roles:
          # this role is used to grant the Prometheus scraper access to this cluster. See eks/prometheus-scraper
          - rolearn: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AWSServiceRoleForAmazonPrometheusScraper_111111111111111"
            username: "acme-plat-ue2-sandbox-prometheus-scraper"
            groups: []
```

Then reapply each given cluster component.

### Scraping Logs

Logs are collected with Loki and Promtail by Grafana.

Grafana Loki is a set of resources that can be combined into a fully featured logging stack. Unlike other logging
systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing metadata about your logs: labels (just like Prometheus labels).
Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores such as S3 or GCS, or even locally on a
filesystem.

Whereas Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to Loki. Promtail scrapers logs from an EKS cluster,
and can be enabled to receive logs on its own via an API server.

Both Loki and Promtail are deployed to EKS via Helm charts. Deploy these with the `eks/loki` and `eks/promtail`
components respectively.

First deploy `eks/loki`. Add the `eks/loki` component and stack catalog as such:

::::tip Internal ALBs

We recommend using an internal ALB for logging services. You must connect to the private network to access the Loki
endpoint.

::::

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    eks/loki:
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: loki
        alb_controller_ingress_group_component_name: eks/alb-controller-ingress-group/internal
```

Then deploy the `eks/promtail` component with an example stack catalog as follows:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    eks/promtail:
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: promtail
```

Import both into any account where you have an EKS cluster, and deploy then in order. For example `plat-use2-dev`.

```console
atmos terraform apply eks/loki -s plat-use2-dev
atmos terraform apply eks/promtail -s plat-use2-dev
```

### Amazon Managed Grafana Workspace

Now that we have metrics and logs collected in each platform account, we want to create a central "hub" for accessing
that data. That hub is Grafana.

The primary component of Amazon Managed Grafana is the workspace. The Amazon Managed Grafana workspace is the logically
isolated Grafana server, where we can create Grafana dashboards and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and
traces without having to build, package, or deploy any hardware to run your Grafana servers.

Deploy the centralized Amazon Managed Grafana workspace to `core-auto` with the `managed-grafana/workspace` component.
For example

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    grafana:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/workspace
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: grafana
        private_network_access_enabled: true
        sso_role_associations:
          - role: "ADMIN"
            group_ids:
              - "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        # This grafana workspace will be allowed to assume the cross
        # account access role from these prometheus components.
        # Add all plat accounts after deploying prometheus in those accounts
        prometheus_source_accounts:
          - component: prometheus
            tenant: plat
            stage: sandbox
          - component: prometheus
            tenant: plat
            stage: dev
```

Import this component in `core-use2-auto` (your primary region), and then deploy this component with the following:

```bash
atmos terraform apply grafana -s core-use2-auto
```

### Managing Terraform

We have fully Terraformed this Grafana-based monitoring system using the
[Grafana Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest). We deploy an API Key after
creating the workspace and then use that API key to create all necessary Grafana sub components, including all data
sources and dashboards.

Create that API key with the `managed-grafana/api-key` component.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    grafana/api-key
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/api-key
      vars:
        enabled: true
        grafana_component_name: grafana
```

Then deploy it in the same account as the Grafana workspace.

```console
atmos terraform apply grafana/api-key -s core-use2-auto
```

::::info API Key Rotation

By default, this Grafana API key will expire after 30 days (max). The component is configured to automatically suggest
replacing API key after that expiration date, but Terraform will need to be reapplied to refresh that key.

::::

Now other Grafana sub components will be able to pull that API key from AWS SSM and use it to access the Grafana
workspace.

### Adding Data Sources

In order to visualize and query metrics and logs, we need to add each as a data source for the centralized Amazon
Managed Grafana workspace. We have created a data source component for each type.

Use the `managed-grafana/data-source/managed-prometheus` component to add the Managed Prometheus workspace as a data
source for Grafana. Add the following stack catalog:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    grafana/datasource/defaults:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/data-source/managed-prometheus
        type: abstract
      vars:
        enabled: true
        grafana_component_name: grafana
        grafana_api_key_component_name: grafana/api-key
        prometheus_component_name: prometheus

    grafana/datasource/plat-sandbox-prometheus:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/data-source/managed-prometheus
        inherits:
          - grafana/datasource/defaults
      vars:
        name: plat-sandbox-prometheus
        prometheus_tenant_name: plat
        prometheus_stage_name: sandbox

    grafana/datasource/plat-dev-prometheus:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/data-source/managed-prometheus
        inherits:
          - grafana/datasource/defaults
      vars:
        name: plat-dev-prometheus
        prometheus_tenant_name: plat
        prometheus_stage_name: dev

    # Plus all other Prometheus deployments ...
```

Then deploy the components into the same stack as Grafana. For example `core-use2-auto`:

```
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-sandbox-prometheus -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-dev-prometheus -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-staging-prometheus -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-prod-prometheus -s core-use2-auto
```

Use the `managed-grafana/data-source/loki` component to add Grafana Loki as a data source for Grafana. Add the following
stack catalog to the same catalog you used for the Prometheus data sources.

```yaml
components:
  terraform: ...

  # These use the same default data source component defined for the prometheus
  # data source components, since the inputs and structure are the mostly the same
  grafana/datasource/plat-sandbox-loki:
    metadata:
      component: managed-grafana/data-source/loki
      inherits:
        - grafana/datasource/defaults
    vars:
      name: plat-sandbox-loki
      loki_tenant_name: plat
      loki_stage_name: sandbox

  grafana/datasource/plat-dev-loki:
    metadata:
      component: managed-grafana/data-source/loki
      inherits:
        - grafana/datasource/defaults
    vars:
      name: plat-dev-loki
      loki_tenant_name: plat
      loki_stage_name: dev

  # Plus all other Loki deployments ...
```

Then deploy the components into the same stack as Grafana. For example `core-use2-auto`:

```console
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-sandbox-loki -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-dev-loki -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-staging-loki -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/datasource/plat-prod-loki -s core-use2-auto
```

### Creating Dashboards

We fully support Terraformed Grafana dashboards with the `managed-grafana/dashboard` component. Search the
[Grafana Dashboard Library](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) to find the dashboards that best suite your
requirements. Once you've found a dashboard, copy the dashboard URL from "Download JSON". Right click "Download JSON"
and select "Copy Link Address". This is the dashboard URL we need.

Now create a catalog entry. For example, see the stack catalog below where we create a dashboard _for each_ of our data
sources defined earlier.

When you import a dashboard in the Grafana UI, you can specify the dashboard inputs after importing. For these
components, we instead specify the inputs that we want to replace before creating the dashboard. We do that with
`var.config_input`. This map variable will take a specific string as the map key and replace all occurrences of that
string with the given value. However to know what that input value is, you will need to open the dashboard JSON and find
any value in `${ }` format; although these can usually be logically determined by the type of the data source prefixed
with `DS_`. For example a Prometheus data source would likely be `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` and a Loki data source would likely
be `${DS_LOKI}`. Be sure to include `${ }` in the map key; we want to replace it entirely in the rendered JSON.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    grafana/dashboard/defaults:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/dashboard
        type: abstract
      vars:
        enabled: true
        grafana_component_name: grafana
        grafana_api_key_component_name: grafana/api-key

    grafana/dashboard/plat-sandbox-prometheus:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/dashboard
        inherits:
          - grafana/dashboard/defaults
      vars:
        dashboard_name: acme-plat-ue2-sandbox-prometheus
        dashboard_url: "https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/315/revisions/3/download"
        config_input:
          "${DS_PROMETHEUS}": "acme-plat-ue2-sandbox-prometheus"

    grafana/dashboard/plat-sandbox-loki:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/dashboard
        inherits:
          - grafana/dashboard/defaults
      vars:
        dashboard_name: acme-plat-ue2-sandbox-loki
        dashboard_url: "https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/13639/revisions/2/download"
        config_input:
          "${DS_LOKI}": "acme-plat-ue2-sandbox-loki"

    grafana/dashboard/plat-dev-prometheus:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/dashboard
        inherits:
          - grafana/dashboard/defaults
      vars:
        dashboard_name: acme-plat-ue2-dev-prometheus
        dashboard_url: "https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/315/revisions/3/download"
        config_input:
          "${DS_PROMETHEUS}": "acme-plat-ue2-dev-prometheus"

    grafana/dashboard/plat-dev-loki:
      metadata:
        component: managed-grafana/dashboard
        inherits:
          - grafana/dashboard/defaults
      vars:
        dashboard_name: acme-plat-ue2-dev-loki
        dashboard_url: "https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/13639/revisions/2/download"
        config_input:
          "${DS_LOKI}": "acme-plat-ue2-dev-loki"

    # Plus all other data sources in staging, prod, etc ...
```

Now import this stack file into the same stack as Grafana, for example `core-use2-auto`, and deploy those components:

```console
atmos terraform apply grafana/dashboard/plat-sandbox-prometheus -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/dashboard/plat-sandbox-loki -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/dashboard/plat-dev-prometheus -s core-use2-auto
atmos terraform apply grafana/dashboard/plat-dev-loki -s core-use2-auto
```

And that's it! Validate the set up in Grafana. Open the Grafana workspace, select the menu in the top left, click
"Dashboards". Choose any of your newly deployed dashboards.
