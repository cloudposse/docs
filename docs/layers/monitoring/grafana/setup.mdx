<Intro>
  Grafana is built around the Amazon managed services for Grafana and Prometheus.
</Intro>

<Note>
  At this time, we have implemented only the EKS integrations with AWS Managed Grafana. We are open to adding ECS support. These instructions include the steps for integrated EKS with AWS Managed Grafana.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Vendor Components

    Vendor all required components

    ```console
    atmos workflow vendor -f grafana
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy Grafana

    Please see [How to Setup Grafana](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/tutorials/how-to-setup-grafana) for in depth documentation.

    However, if you can find the summary of steps in Atmos Workflows here. You can choose to run these workflows
    one-by-one, or run them altogether with the following:

    ```console
    atmos workflow deploy -f grafana
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy all data sources

    Deploy Prometheus and Loki to `plat-dev`, `plat-staging`, and `plat-prod`. Run the following Atmos Workflow:

    ```console
    atmos workflow deploy/data-sources -f grafana -s plat-use1-dev
    atmos workflow deploy/data-sources -f grafana -s plat-use1-staging
    atmos workflow deploy/data-sources -f grafana -s plat-use1-prod
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/>  Grant the Prometheus Scraper Access to EKS

    After deploying the `eks/prometheus-scraper` component, you will need to reapply the `eks/cluster` component with an
    update to `var.map_additional_iam_roles`.

    ```console
    atmos terraform output eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use1-dev
    atmos terraform output eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use1-staging
    atmos terraform output eks/prometheus-scraper -s plat-use1-prod
    ```

    Note the `scraper_role_arn` and `clusterrole_username` outputs and set them to `rolearn` and `username` respectively
    with the `map_additional_iam_roles` input for `eks/cluster`.

    ```yaml
    # stacks/orgs/acme/plat/STAGE/us-east-1/eks.yaml
    components:
      terraform:
        eks/cluster:
          vars:
            map_additional_iam_roles:
              # this role is used to grant the Prometheus scraper access to this cluster. See eks/prometheus-scraper
              - rolearn: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AWSServiceRoleForAmazonPrometheusScraper_111111111111111"
                username: "acme-plat-ue2-sandbox-prometheus-scraper"
                groups: []
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/>  Reapply EKS Cluster

    Then reapply `eks/cluster`:

    ```console
    atmos terraform apply eks/cluster -s plat-use1-dev
    atmos terraform apply eks/cluster -s plat-use1-staging
    atmos terraform apply eks/cluster -s plat-use1-prod
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/>  Deploy Grafana

    Deploy the Amazon Managed Grafana workspace, API key, data-source integrations, and finally dashboards:

    ```console
    atmos workflow deploy/grafana -s core-use1-auto -f grafana
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Accessing Grafana

    <Admonition type="info" title="Custom URLs">
      We would prefer to have a custom URL for the provisioned Grafana workspace, but at the moment it's not supported
      natively and implementation would be non-trivial. We will continue to monitor that Issue and consider alternatives, such
      as using Cloudfront.

      [Issue #6: Support for Custom Domains](https://github.com/aws/amazon-managed-grafana-roadmap/issues/6)
    </Admonition>

    You can access Grafana from the Grafana workspace endpoint that is output by the `grafana` component:

    ```console
    atmos terraform output grafana -s core-use1-auto
    ```

    Or you can open your AWS Single-Sign-On page, navigate to the "Applications" tab, and then select "Amazon Grafana".
