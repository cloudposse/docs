# How to Upgrade or Install Versions of Terraform

## Problem
You want to install or upgrade to a specific version of terraform, ideally, without affecting anything that needs newer or older versions of terraform.

## Solution

#### Install Desired Version of Terraform
First, make sure youâ€™ve installed the latest version of `terraform` in [Geodesic](/fundamentals/geodesic). Installation instructions will vary depending on if youâ€™re using Alpine, Ubuntu, or CentOS.

We publish special [packages](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages) for terraform to support installing multiple versions simultaneously. We support package pinning going back as far as Terraform 0.11 (remember those days? ðŸ˜µ ).

:::info
We support installing multiple versions of terraform **without** using a version manager like `tfenv`.

:::
Youâ€™ll want to install the desired version of terraform by adding it to the `Dockerfile` for your infrastructure repository.

E.g.

```
RUN apt-get install -y terraform-1
```
