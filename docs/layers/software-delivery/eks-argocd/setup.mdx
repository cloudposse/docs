## Requirements

In order to deploy ArgoCD, EKS must be fully deployed and functional. In particular, the user deploying the cluster must
have a working VPN connection to the targeted account. See
[the EKS documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architecture/setup/eks/) for details.

All deployment steps below assume that the environment has been successfully set up with the following steps.

<Steps>
  1. Sign into AWS via Leapp
  1. Connect to the VPN
  1. Open Geodesic
</Steps>

<Steps>
  # Steps
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Vendor Components

    First vendor all related components for the ArgoCD layer:

    ```console
    atmos workflow vendor -f argocd
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>

    ## <StepNumber/> Establish a Bot User

    We deploy a number of GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as part of the EKS with ArgoCD application. By default each
    PAT is given the least-access required for the given job.

    Each one of these PATs will be associated with a given user. We recommend creating or using an existing "bot" user. For
    example, at Cloud Posse we have the "cloudpossebot" GitHub user. This user has its own email address and GitHub account,
    is accessible from our internal 1Password vault for all privileged users, and has all access keys and tokens stored with
    it in 1Password.

    This bot user will need permission to manage a few repositories in your Organization. If you wish to simplify
    deployment, you can grant this user permission to create repositories. See (Create Permission for the Bot User)[#Create
    Permission for the Bot User].

    Use this bot user for all access tokens in the remainder of this guide.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Create ArgoCD GitHub Repositories

    <Steps>
      - Create the two required ArgoCD GitHub repos:
        <TaskList>
        - [acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod)
        - [acme/argocd-deploy-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-prod)
        </TaskList>

      - Then grant the bot user `Admin` access to these two repositories.
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Create all ArgoCD PATs

    We will need several PATs for the following steps. Now that the ArgoCD repos are created, you can create all required
    PATs.

    Please see
    [ArgoCD Integrations: How to set up Authorization for ArgoCD with GitHub PATs](/layers/software-delivery/eks-argocd/tutorials/pats)
    and follow all steps.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy ArgoCD GitHub Repositories Configuration

    Deploy the ArgoCD configuration for the two GitHub repos with the following workflow:

    ```console
    atmos workflow argocd-repos -f argocd
    ```

    Once this finishes, review the two repos in your GitHub Organization. These should both be fully configured at this
    point.

    - [acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod)
    - [acme/argocd-deploy-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-prod)

    Now that the ArgoCD deployment repos are configured, we need to create GitHub PATs for ArgoCD.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Create AWS Identity Center Applications

    In order to authenticate with ArgoCD, we recommend using an AWS IAM Identity Center SAML Application. These apps can use existing Identity Center groups that we've already setup as part of the [Identity layer](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architecture/setup/identity/).

    Please see [ArgoCD Integrations: How to create an AWS Identity Center Application](/layers/software-delivery/eks-argocd/tutorials/identity-center-apps) and follow all steps.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy ArgoCD to each EKS Cluster

    Once the GitHub repositories are in place and the SAML applications have been created and configuration uploaded to SSM,
    we're ready to deploy ArgoCD to each cluster.

    Deploy `eks/argocd` to each cluster with the following workflow:

    ```console
    atmos workflow deploy/argocd -f argocd
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Validation

    Once all deployment steps are completed, ArgoCD should be accessible at the following URLs. Please note that you must be
    able to authenticate with AWS Identity Center to access any given app.
    <TaskList>
      - https://argocd.use1.dev.plat.acme-svc.com
      - https://argocd.use1.staging.plat.acme-svc.com
      - https://argocd.use1.prod.plat.acme-svc.com
    </TaskList>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Assuming login goes well, here's a checklist of GitHub repos needed to connect ArgoCD:

<TaskList>
  - [ ] `acme/infra-acme` repo (Should already exist!)
    - [ ] `acme/infra-acme/.github/environments` private
          workflows. This directory stores private environment configurations. Primarily, that is the
          [`cloudposse/github-action-yaml-config-query`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-yaml-config-query)
          action used to get role, namespace, and cluster mapping for each environment.
  - [ ] (2) ArgoCD deploy nonprod and prod (Should already be created by `argocd-repo` component in earlier step)
    - [ ] `argocd-deploy-non-prod`
    - [ ] `argocd-deploy-prod`
  - [ ] `acme/example-app` repo should be private repo generated from the
        [app-on-eks-with-argocd](https://github.com/cloudposse-examples/app-on-eks-with-argocd) template
</TaskList>

:::info Sensitive Log Output

Note that all of these workflow runs run from within your private app repo, so any sensitive log output will not be
public.

:::

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Environment Configuration

    Update the `cloudposse/github-action-interface-environment` action to point to your infrastructure repository.

    1. Set `implementation_repository` to `acme/infra-acme`
    2. Verify `implementation_path`, `implementation_file`, and `implementation_ref` match your local configuration.

    [Example app reference](https://github.com/cloudposse-examples/app-on-eks-with-argocd/blob/1abe260c7f43dde1c6610845e5a64a9d08eb8856/.github/workflows/workflow-cd-preview-argocd.yml#L167-L178)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Verify GitHub OIDC Access Roles

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Capitalization Matters!">
      The IDP permissions in IAM will be sensitive to capitalization, and yet the docker image must -not- have uppercase letters!
    </Admonition>

    Make sure that your repo is allowed to assume roles for all relevant clusters and ECR repos:
    <Steps>
      1. Update the `github_actions_allowed_repos` variable in `ecr`, `eks/cluster`, or any other relevant components with
        GitHub OIDC access.
      2. If your GitHub Organization has mixed capitalization cases, make sure these entries are case-sensitive
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> GitHub Environment Secrets

    Add each of the following secrets to the `acme/example-app` repo:

    <Steps>
      1. `github-private-actions-pat`: `${{ secrets.PUBLIC_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN }}`
      2. `registry`: `${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY }}`
      3. `secret-outputs-passphrase`: `${{ secrets.GHA_SECRET_OUTPUT_PASSPHRASE }}`
      4. `ecr-region`: `${{ secrets.ECR_REGION }}`
      5. `ecr-iam-role`: `${{ secrets.ECR_IAM_ROLE }}`
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Specify Ingress Group

    <Steps>
      1. Update the `deploy/releases/app.yaml`
      2. Make sure the ingress is not set to `default`. It should likely be `alb-controller-ingress-group`. you can read more
        about this
        [from our docs on the alb controller component](/layers/eks/faq/#how-does-the-alb-controller-ingress-group-determine-the-name-of-the-alb)
      3. Set the domain accordingly. Each environment will need the service domain + environment.stage.tenant (ie.
        `use2.staging.plat.acme-svc.com` )
      4. If your organization has mixed case, you'll need to edit the `organization` parameter to be lowercased in the GitHub
        workflows: `feature-branch.yml`, `main-branch.yaml`, and `release.yaml`
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ

### Migrating from ArgoCD version `<1.305.0` to `1.305.0`

In order to migrate to `1.305.0` from a lesser version, delete the previous SSM parameters in each account for
`/argocd/notifications/notifiers/service_webhook_github-commit-status/github-token` and redeploy `github-webhook-pat`,
`eks/argocd`, and `argocd-repos`.

Or use the following workflow:

```console
atmos workflow migrate_less_1_305 -f argocd
```

### About GitHub PATs

We deploy a number of GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT). Each has a specific purpose and is limited to the
fine-grained scope required by that specific job. These are as follows:

1. #### Terraform `argocd-repo` Access
   The first PAT we deploy is used by Terraform with the `argocd-repo` component. This PAT is used to create and manage the ArgoCD deployment repositories, add deployment ssh keys for those repos, and is stored in AWS SSM Parameter Store.

   Terraform will pull that PAT from SSM typically using the `argocd/github` path in the `core-auto` account.

2. #### Terraform `eks/argocd` Access

   The next two PATs are also used by Terraform now with the `eks/argocd` component. Each of these PATs is used to register the webhook in GitHub for the ArgoCD Application created with this given component.

   Terraform will pull that PAT from SSM typically using the `argocd/github` path in `plat-dev`, `plat-staging`, and `plat-prod` accounts. You may notice this is the same path as #1 above. These PATs can be combined into a single PAT, as both are only used by Terraform.

3. #### ArgoCD GitHub Notification Access

   The next PAT is used by the ArgoCD notifications system to set the GitHub to commit status on successful deployments. This PAT is stored in SSM and pulled by the `eks/argocd` component. That component will pass the token to the ArgoCD application in the given EKS cluster. That ArgoCD Application uses that PAT only when synchronous mode is enabled.

   We store this PAT in SSM using the `argocd/notifications/notifiers/common/github-token` path

4. #### GitHub Release Workflow Access

  The final two PATs are used in the release engineering workflows; one for nonprod and one for prod. This token should allow write permissions in `infra-acme` and the given ArgoCD deploy repo.
