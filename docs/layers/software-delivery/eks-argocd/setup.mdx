<Intro>
 This setup guide will walk you through the process of setting up Argo CD in your environment.
</Intro>

## Requirements

In order to deploy Argo CD, EKS must be fully deployed and functional. In particular, the user deploying the cluster must
have a working VPN connection to the targeted account. See
[the EKS documentation](/layers/eks/deploy-clusters/) for details.

All deployment steps below assume that the environment has been successfully set up with the following steps.

### Authentication

<Steps>
  1. Sign into AWS via Leapp
  1. Connect to the VPN
  1. Open Geodesic
</Steps>

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Vendor Argo CD components

    First vendor all related components for the Argo CD layer:

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="vendor" fileName="argocd" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Create Argo CD GitHub Repositories

    <Steps>
      - Create the two required Argo CD GitHub repos:
        <TaskList>
        - [acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod)
        - [acme/argocd-deploy-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-prod)
        </TaskList>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Prepare Authentication

    Argo CD can be integrated with GitHub using either GitHub Apps (recommended) or Personal Access Tokens (PATs). GitHub Apps provide more granular permissions, better security, and improved audit capabilities.

    Argo CD requires several different types of GitHub authentication for various components and workflows. While these could be combined, we follow the principle of least privilege by creating separate authentication credentials for each specific purpose. The following authentication methods are required:

    <Steps>
    1. #### Terraform `argocd-repo` Access
       The first PAT is used by Terraform with the `argocd-repo` component. This is used to create and manage the Argo CD desired state repositories and (optionally) add deployment ssh keys for those repos.

       Terraform will pull that PAT from SSM typically using the `argocd/github` path in the `core-auto` account.

       Alternatively, you can required local access to apply the component. This would require an engineer to locally authenticate with GitHub and apply this component locally. Since this component is rarely updated, this can be a reasonable trade-off.

       At this time, we do not have GitHub App support for this step and prefer using local developer access.

    2. #### Terraform `eks/argocd` Access

       The next two PATs or GitHub App installations are also used by Terraform now with the `eks/argocd` component. Each of these is used to register the webhook in GitHub for the Argo CD Application created with this given component. One is used for non-prod stages and the other is used for prod stages.

       Terraform will pull that token from SSM typically in `plat-dev`, `plat-staging`, and `plat-prod` accounts. 

    3. #### Argo CD GitHub Notification Access

       The next PAT or GitHub App token is used by the Argo CD notifications system to set the GitHub to commit status on successful deployments. This is stored in SSM and pulled by the `eks/argocd` component. That component will pass the token to the Argo CD instance in the given EKS cluster. That Argo CD instance uses that token _only when synchronous mode is enabled_.

    4. #### GitHub Release Workflow Access

       The final two PATs or GitHub App installations are used in the release engineering workflows: one for non-prod and one for prod. This token should allow write permissions in the given Argo CD desired state repositories.

    </Steps>

      <TabItem value="github-apps" label="GitHub Apps (Recommended)">
        <Steps>
          <Step>
            ## <StepNumber/> Set up GitHub Apps

            Follow the instructions in [Argo CD Integrations: How to set up Authorization for Argo CD with GitHub Apps](/layers/software-delivery/eks-argocd/tutorials/github-apps) to create and configure a GitHub App for Argo CD.
          </Step>

          <Step>
            ## <StepNumber/> Configure Argo CD Desire State Repositories to Use GitHub Apps

            Update your Argo CD desired state repository configuration to use the GitHub App instead of PAT:

            ```yaml
            components:
              terraform:
                argocd-repo:
                  vars:
                    # 1. Use local access to apply this component rather than a PAT
                    # https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs#github-cli
                    use_local_github_credentials: true

                    # 2. If synchronous mode is enabled, set the notifications to send to "github" and not to the "webhook"
                    github_notifications:
                      - "notifications.argoproj.io/subscribe.on-deploy-started.github: \"\""
                      - "notifications.argoproj.io/subscribe.on-deploy-succeeded.github: \"\""
                      - "notifications.argoproj.io/subscribe.on-deploy-failed.github: \"\""

                    # 3. Optional, disable the SSH deploy keys to use a GitHub App 
                    #    for the Argo CD instance to authenticate with the desired state repository
                    deploy_keys_enabled: false
            ```

          </Step>

          <Step>
            ## <StepNumber/> Configure Argo CD to Use GitHub Apps

            Update your Argo CD configuration to use the GitHub App instead of PATs:

            ```yaml
            components:
              terraform:
                eks/argocd:
                  vars:
                    # GitHub App (Argo CD Instance)
                    # This GitHub App is used for the Argo CD instance to manage webhooks and read from the desired state repository.
                    # ie https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod
                    github_app_enabled: true
                    github_app_id: "1234567"
                    github_app_installation_id: "44444444"
                    # The SSM parameter must exist in the account and region where Argo CD is deployed.
                    ssm_github_app_private_key: "/argocd/argo_cd_instance/app_private_key"
                    # Optional, disable the SSH deploy keys to use this GitHub App 
                    # for the Argo CD instance to authenticate with the desired state repository
                    github_deploy_keys_enabled: false

                    # GitHub App (Argo CD Notifications)
                    # This GitHub App is used for the Argo CD instance to send commit status updates back to each ap repository.
                    # This is only required if synchronous mode is enabled.
                    # ie https://github.com/acme/example-app-on-eks
                    github_notifications_app_enabled: true
                    github_notifications_app_id: "8901235"
                    github_notifications_app_installation_id: "55555555"
                    # The SSM parameter must exist in the account and region where Argo CD is deployed.
                    ssm_github_notifications_app_private_key: "/argocd/argo_cd_notifications/app_private_key"
            ```
          </Step>

        </Steps>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="pats" label="Personal Access Tokens (Legacy)">
        <Steps>
          <Step>
            ## <StepNumber/> Establish a Bot User

            We deploy a number of GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as part of the EKS with Argo CD application. By default each
            PAT is given the least-access required for the given job.

            Each one of these PATs will be associated with a given user. We recommend creating or using an existing "bot" user. For
            example, at Cloud Posse we have the "cloudpossebot" GitHub user. This user has its own email address and GitHub account,
            is accessible from our internal 1Password vault for all privileged users, and has all access keys and tokens stored with
            it in 1Password.

            This bot user will need permission to manage a few repositories in your Organization. If you wish to simplify
            deployment, you can grant this user permission to create repositories. See (Create Permission for the Bot User)[#Create
            Permission for the Bot User].

            Use this bot user for all access tokens in the remainder of this guide.
          </Step>

          <Step>
            ## <StepNumber/> Create all Argo CD PATs

            We will need several PATs for the following steps. Now that the Argo CD repos are created, you can create all required
            PATs.

            Please see
            [Argo CD Integrations: How to set up Authorization for Argo CD with GitHub PATs](/layers/software-delivery/eks-argocd/tutorials/pats)
            and follow all steps.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy Argo CD repo configuration

    Deploy the Argo CD configuration for the two GitHub repos with the following workflow:

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/argocd-repos" fileName="argocd" />

    Once this finishes, review the two repos in your GitHub Organization. These should both be fully configured at this point.

    - [acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-non-prod)
    - [acme/argocd-deploy-prod](https://github.com/acme/argocd-deploy-prod)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Create AWS Identity Center Applications

    In order to authenticate with Argo CD, we recommend using an AWS IAM Identity Center SAML Application. These apps can use existing Identity Center groups that we've already setup as part of the [Identity layer](/layers/identity/).

    Please see [Argo CD Integrations: How to create an AWS Identity Center Application](/layers/software-delivery/eks-argocd/tutorials/identity-center-apps) and follow all steps.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy Argo CD to each EKS Cluster

    Once the GitHub repositories are in place and the SAML applications have been created and configuration uploaded to SSM,
    we're ready to deploy Argo CD to each cluster.

    Deploy `eks/argocd` to each cluster with the following workflow:

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/argocd" fileName="argocd" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Validation

    Once all deployment steps are completed, Argo CD should be accessible at the following URLs. Please note that you must be
    able to authenticate with AWS Identity Center to access any given app.
    <TaskList>
      - https://argocd.use1.dev.plat.acme-svc.com
      - https://argocd.use1.staging.plat.acme-svc.com
      - https://argocd.use1.prod.plat.acme-svc.com
    </TaskList>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Assuming login goes well, here's a checklist of GitHub repos needed to connect Argo CD:

<TaskList>
  - [ ] `acme/infra-acme` repo (Should already exist!)
    - [ ] `acme/infra-acme/.github/environments` private
          workflows. This directory stores private environment configurations. Primarily, that is the
          [`cloudposse/github-action-yaml-config-query`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-yaml-config-query)
          action used to get role, namespace, and cluster mapping for each environment.
  - [ ] (2) Argo CD deploy nonprod and prod (Should already be created by `argocd-repo` component in earlier step)
    - [ ] `argocd-deploy-non-prod`
    - [ ] `argocd-deploy-prod`
  - [ ] `acme/example-app` repo should be private repo generated from the
        [app-on-eks-with-argocd](https://github.com/cloudposse-examples/app-on-eks-with-argocd) template
</TaskList>

:::info Sensitive Log Output

Note that all of these workflow runs run from within your private app repo, so any sensitive log output will not be
public.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Environment Configuration

    Update the `cloudposse/github-action-interface-environment` action to point to your infrastructure repository.

    1. Set `implementation_repository` to `acme/infra-acme`
    2. Verify `implementation_path`, `implementation_file`, and `implementation_ref` match your local configuration.

    [Example app reference](https://github.com/cloudposse-examples/app-on-eks-with-argocd/blob/1abe260c7f43dde1c6610845e5a64a9d08eb8856/.github/workflows/workflow-cd-preview-argocd.yml#L167-L178)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Verify GitHub OIDC Access Roles

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Capitalization Matters!">
      The IDP permissions in IAM will be sensitive to capitalization, and yet the docker image must -not- have uppercase letters!
    </Admonition>

    Make sure that your repo is allowed to assume roles for all relevant clusters and ECR repos:
    <Steps>
      1. Update the `github_actions_allowed_repos` variable in `ecr`, `eks/cluster`, or any other relevant components with
        GitHub OIDC access.
      2. If your GitHub Organization has mixed capitalization cases, make sure these entries are case-sensitive
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> GitHub Environment Secrets

    Add each of the following secrets to the `acme/example-app` repo:

    <Steps>
      1. `github-private-actions-pat`: `${{ secrets.PUBLIC_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN }}`
      2. `registry`: `${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY }}`
      3. `secret-outputs-passphrase`: `${{ secrets.GHA_SECRET_OUTPUT_PASSPHRASE }}`
      4. `ecr-region`: `${{ secrets.ECR_REGION }}`
      5. `ecr-iam-role`: `${{ secrets.ECR_IAM_ROLE }}`
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Specify Ingress Group

    <Steps>
      1. Update the `deploy/releases/app.yaml`
      2. Make sure the ingress is not set to `default`. It should likely be `alb-controller-ingress-group`. you can read more
        about this
        [from our docs on the alb controller component](/layers/eks/faq/#how-does-the-alb-controller-ingress-group-determine-the-name-of-the-alb)
      3. Set the domain accordingly. Each environment will need the service domain + environment.stage.tenant (ie.
        `use2.staging.plat.acme-svc.com` )
      4. If your organization has mixed case, you'll need to edit the `organization` parameter to be lowercased in the GitHub
        workflows: `feature-branch.yml`, `main-branch.yaml`, and `release.yaml`
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ

### Migrating from Argo CD version `<1.305.0` to `1.305.0`

In order to migrate to `1.305.0` from a lesser version, delete the previous SSM parameters in each account for
`/argocd/notifications/notifiers/service_webhook_github-commit-status/github-token` and redeploy `github-webhook-pat`,
`eks/argocd`, and `argocd-repos`.

Or use the following workflow:

<AtmosWorkflow workflow="migrate_less_1_305" fileName="argocd" />

### GitHub Apps vs Personal Access Tokens

We recommend using GitHub Apps for Argo CD integration with GitHub. GitHub Apps offer several advantages over Personal Access Tokens:

1. **Granular Permissions**: GitHub Apps can be granted access to specific repositories rather than requiring organization-wide access.

2. **Better Security**: GitHub Apps use JWT authentication and short-lived tokens, reducing the risk of token exposure.

3. **Improved Audit Capabilities**: Actions performed by GitHub Apps are clearly identified in audit logs.

4. **Rate Limiting**: GitHub Apps have their own rate limits, separate from user-based limits.

5. **Webhook Support**: GitHub Apps can receive webhooks for events in repositories they have access to.

6. **Multiple Installations**: The same GitHub App can be installed on different repositories with different permissions.

For more information on setting up Argo CD with GitHub Apps, see [Argo CD Integrations: How to set up Authorization for Argo CD with GitHub Apps](/layers/software-delivery/eks-argocd/tutorials/github-apps).
