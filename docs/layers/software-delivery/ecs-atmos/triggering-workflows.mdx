<Intro>
  Once the ECS application setup is complete, validate the CI/CD workflows by triggering deployments through pull requests and releases.
</Intro>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Create a Pull Request

    Create a PR and add the `deploy` label to deploy a preview environment:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/test-preview
    # Make changes
    git push origin feature/test-preview
    ```

    Then add the `deploy` label to the PR in GitHub.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Merge PR into Main Branch

    Push any change to the `main` branch to trigger the main branch workflow:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial setup"
    git push origin main
    ```

    This will:
    - Build and push a Docker image to ECR
    - Deploy to the `dev` environment
    - Create a draft release
  </Step>


  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Publish a Release

    Edit the draft release created by the main branch workflow and click "Publish release". This will:
    - Promote the Docker image tag
    - Deploy to `staging`
    - Wait for approval (if configured)
    - Deploy to `prod`
  </Step>
</Steps>
