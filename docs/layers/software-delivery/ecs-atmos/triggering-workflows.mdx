<Intro>
  Once the ECS application setup is complete, validate the CI/CD workflows by triggering deployments through pull requests and releases. This guide explains what happens at each stage and where to monitor your deployments.
</Intro>

## Deployment Environments

Each environment maps to a specific ECS cluster and GitHub Environment:

| Environment | ECS Cluster | GitHub Environment | Trigger |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Preview | `dev` cluster | `preview` | PR with `deploy` label |
| Dev | `dev` cluster | `dev` | Push to `main` |
| Staging | `staging` cluster | `staging` | Publish release |
| Production | `prod` cluster | `prod` | After staging (with approval) |

<Admonition type="info" title="Cluster Selection">
  The target ECS cluster is determined by the Atmos stack configuration. Each stack (e.g., `dev.yaml`, `staging.yaml`, `prod.yaml`) specifies its target cluster through the `vars.environment` setting, which maps to infrastructure deployed in your platform accounts.
</Admonition>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy a Preview Environment

    Preview environments let you test changes before merging to `main`. They deploy to the `dev` cluster with isolated resources.

    **To trigger a preview deployment:**

    <TaskList>
      - [ ] Create a feature branch and push changes
      - [ ] Open a pull request targeting `main`
      - [ ] Add the `deploy` label to the PR
    </TaskList>

    **CI/CD steps that run:**

    1. **Build** — Builds Docker image and pushes to ECR with tag `sha-<commit>`
    2. **Deploy** — Runs `atmos terraform deploy app -s preview` to create/update the ECS service

    **Where to see your preview environment:**

    - **GitHub UI**: Click the "Deployments" section in your PR, or look for the environment link in the workflow summary
    - **AWS Console**: Navigate to ECS → Clusters → `dev` cluster → Services → look for service with PR number suffix
    - **Application URL**: The workflow outputs the URL — check the "Deploy" job summary

    **Cleanup:**

    Preview environments are automatically destroyed when:
    - The PR is closed or merged
    - The `deploy` label is removed

    The `preview-cleanup.yml` workflow runs `atmos terraform destroy app -s preview` to remove all resources.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy to Dev

    Merging to `main` automatically deploys to the `dev` environment.

    **To trigger a dev deployment:**

    <TaskList>
      - [ ] Merge your PR to `main` (or push directly to `main`)
    </TaskList>

    **CI/CD steps that run:**

    1. **Build** — Builds Docker image and pushes to ECR with tag `sha-<commit>`
    2. **Deploy** — Runs `atmos terraform deploy app -s dev` to update the ECS service
    3. **Release** — Creates a draft GitHub Release for promotion

    **Where to see your dev deployment:**

    - **GitHub UI**: Go to Actions → "Main Branch" workflow → click the `dev` environment link
    - **AWS Console**: ECS → Clusters → `dev` cluster → Services → your app service
    - **Application URL**: Check the "Deploy" job output for the URL
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy to Staging

    Staging deployments are triggered by publishing a GitHub Release.

    **To trigger a staging deployment:**

    <TaskList>
      - [ ] Go to GitHub → Releases → find the draft release created by the main branch workflow
      - [ ] Edit the release — add release notes if desired
      - [ ] Click "Publish release"
    </TaskList>

    **CI/CD steps that run:**

    1. **Promote** — Tags the Docker image with the release version (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
    2. **Deploy Staging** — Runs `atmos terraform deploy app -s staging` to update the ECS service

    **Where to see your staging deployment:**

    - **GitHub UI**: Actions → "Release" workflow → click the `staging` environment link
    - **AWS Console**: ECS → Clusters → `staging` cluster → Services → your app service
    - **Application URL**: Check the "deploy / staging" job output
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy to Production

    Production deployment happens automatically after staging, with an optional approval gate.

    **CI/CD steps that run:**

    1. **Wait for approval** (if configured)
    2. **Deploy Production** — Runs `atmos terraform deploy app -s prod` to update the ECS service

    **Where to see your production deployment:**

    - **GitHub UI**: Actions → "Release" workflow → click the `prod` environment link
    - **AWS Console**: ECS → Clusters → `prod` cluster → Services → your app service
    - **Application URL**: Check the "deploy / production" job output

    **Configuring approval gates:**

    To require manual approval before production deployments:

    1. Go to your repository → Settings → Environments
    2. Click on the `prod` environment (create it if it doesn't exist)
    3. Check "Required reviewers"
    4. Add the users or teams who can approve deployments
    5. Optionally set a "Wait timer" to add a delay before deployment

    <Admonition type="tip" title="GitHub Enterprise">
      Approval gates require GitHub Enterprise or a public repository. For GitHub Team plans, consider using a separate workflow with manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`) for production.
    </Admonition>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring Deployments

### GitHub Actions

All deployment status is visible in the GitHub Actions tab:

- **Workflow runs**: See all triggered workflows and their status
- **Environment deployments**: Each environment shows deployment history
- **Job logs**: Click into any job to see detailed logs including Terraform output

### AWS Console

Monitor your ECS services directly:

1. Navigate to **ECS** → **Clusters** → select your cluster
2. Click on your **Service**
3. View the **Deployments** tab to see rollout status
4. Check **Tasks** tab to see running containers
5. View **Logs** tab for application logs (if configured with CloudWatch)

### Application Health

After deployment, verify your application:

<TaskList>
  - [ ] Access the application URL from the workflow output
  - [ ] Check health endpoint (typically `/health` or `/healthz`)
  - [ ] Review CloudWatch logs for any startup errors
  - [ ] Monitor CloudWatch metrics for CPU/memory usage
</TaskList>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Preview not deploying | Verify the `deploy` label is added to the PR |
| "No changes" in Terraform | The image tag might be the same — push a new commit |
| Deployment timeout | Check ECS service events for task startup failures |
| Image not found | Verify ECR permissions and image tag exists |
| Auth errors | Check IAM role trust policy includes your repository |
