## Context and Problem Statement

## Problem Statement

A branching strategy is crucial in software development for facilitating team collaboration,
maintaining code stability, enabling Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD),
ensuring code quality through reviews, simplifying change tracking and rollbacks,
supporting parallel development, and managing different product releases.
It provides individual workspaces for developers, segregates code based on development stages,
automates testing and deployment processes, allows for scrutinized merges into the main codebase,
and supports simultaneous development and maintenance of multiple product versions.
Essentially, an effective branching strategy underpins a stable, manageable, and efficient development environment.

## Options

## Gitflow

[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) has gained popularity as it provides an efficient
framework for collaborative development and scaling development teams. The Gitflow model offers robust control
mechanisms and facilitates collaborative development at a price of a slowdown development speed and higher numbers
of merge conflicts.

Teams working on projects with a massive codebase, low level of automation, and minimum test
code coverage and teams with a high percentage of junior devs all benefit from the Gitflow strategy.

However, Gitflow may not be suitable for startups where development speed is the priority.

   branch featureB order: 2

   commit
   checkout hotfix
   commit
   checkout main
   merge hotfix tag: "0.1.1"
   checkout featureB
   commit
   commit
   checkout develop
   merge featureA
   branch release order: 1
   commit
   commit
   checkout develop
   merge release
   checkout release
   commit
   checkout featureB
   commit
   checkout develop
   merge release
   checkout main
   checkout release
   checkout main
   merge release tag: "0.2.0"
   checkout develop
   merge featureB
   checkout main
   merge develop tag: "0.3.0"
   checkout develop
   commit

```

## GitHub Flow (Trunk-based)

[Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is a lightweight branching strategy where
developers introduce changes as Pull Requests from short-lived, ephemeral feature branches.
Finally, the PRs merged into the single "trunk" branch that is the source of truth.

GitHub Flow works particularly well with a team of experienced developers, facilitating the quick introduction
of improvements without unnecessary bureaucracy. It fits with high automation of release engineering processes,
microservices architecture, and mature engineering culture.

   commit tag: "0.1.0"
   branch release/0.1.0 order: 4
   commit type: HIGHLIGHT id: "0.1.0"
   checkout main
   commit
   checkout main
   branch feature order: 1
   checkout main
   commit tag: "0.2.0"
   branch release/0.2.0 order: 4
   commit type: HIGHLIGHT id: "0.2.0"
   branch hotfix order: 4
   checkout hotfix
   commit
   checkout feature
   commit
   commit
   checkout main
   checkout feature
   commit
   checkout hotfix
   commit
   checkout release/0.2.0
   merge hotfix tag: "0.2.1"
   checkout main
   merge feature
   checkout main
   merge release/0.2.0
   checkout main
   commit  tag: "0.3.0"
   branch release/0.3.0 order: 5
   commit type: HIGHLIGHT id: "0.3.0"
   checkout main
   commit
```

## Recommendation

We recommend using Github Flow as a basic branching strategy in conjunction with Ð¡I/CD workflows
and [branches rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)
for better quality and control over changes.

We highly recommend avoiding long-living branches, especially for software that does not have to support multiple
versions of the software running in the wild.

The branching strategy does not have to be the same across the whole organization - different teams can
use different flows. However, that often leads to complexity in the CI/CD pipelines and reduces reusability.

For these reasons, we recommend a consistent branching strategy, at a minimum on a team level.
