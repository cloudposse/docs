<Intro>
  Deciding on the architecture for Argo CD involves considering multiple
  clusters, plugin management, and Kubernetes integration. This document
  presents recommended strategies, potential risks, and common deployment
  patterns for Argo CD.
</Intro>

## Context

Argo CD is a specialized tool for continuous delivery to Kubernetes, akin to how Terraform Cloud focuses on Terraform deployments. Argo CD does not support deployments outside of Kubernetes (e.g., uploading files to a bucket). While it supports plugins, these are not intended to extend its capabilities beyond Kubernetes.

## Considerations

- Deploy multiple Argo CD instances across clusters to facilitate systematic upgrades in different environments.
- Argo CD operates as a single pod, requiring disruptive restarts to add or upgrade plugins.
- Restarts of Argo CD are disruptive to deployments.
- Increasing the number of Argo CD servers complicates visualizing the delivery process.
- Each Argo CD server must integrate with every cluster it deploys to.
- Argo CD can deploy to the local cluster by using a service account.

### Pros

- Simplifies dependency management across components.
- Protects the KubeAPI by reducing public access requirements.
- Provides a powerful CD tool for Kubernetes with multiple pod rollout strategies.
- Offers a user-friendly UI and supports diverse deployment toolchains within the Argo CD Docker image.
- Enables faster deployments and "backup Kubernetes cluster" capabilities.
- Establishes a consistent framework for continuous deployment independent of the CI platform.

### Cons

- Asynchronous deployments can break the immediate feedback loop from commit to deployment.
- Application CRDs must reside in the namespace where Argo CD runs.
- Application names must be unique per Argo CD instance.
- Custom toolchains require custom Docker images, necessitating Argo CD redeployment.
- Redeploying Argo CD can disrupt active deployments.
- Plugin updates require redeployment since tools must be included in the Docker image.
- Access management involves multiple levels (e.g., GitHub repo access, Argo CD projects, RBAC), introducing complexity.
- Requires additional self-hosted solutions compared to simpler CI-based deployments with Helm 3.
- Repository management for private repos in Argo CD lacks a declarative approach, needing research for potential patterns.
- Argo CD's lifecycle becomes part of the critical path for deployments.

## Recommendations

- **Deploy one Argo CD instance per cluster** to simplify upgrades and manage disruptions effectively.
- **Use a single Argo CD instance for all namespaces within a cluster** to centralize deployment management and reduce complexity.
- **Adopt a dedicated repository strategy** managed by Terraform via the GitHub Terraform provider:
  - One repository for production environments.
  - One repository for non-production environments.
  - One repository for preview environments.
- **Avoid using plugins**:
  - Commit raw manifests (e.g., rendered from Helm templates or Kustomize) directly to the repository.
  - Shift manifest rendering to CI to ensure predictable, verifiable deployments.
  - This approach simplifies troubleshooting, avoids plugin upgrade issues, and ensures complete visibility into what is deployed.
- **Deploy operators that require IAM roles and backing services with Terraform**, not Argo CD, to ensure proper role management and infrastructure provisioning.
- **Use Argo CD for application deployments** in combination with GitHub Actions to streamline deployment pipelines and align with CI/CD best practices.
- **Use Helm to Provision Argo CD** with Terraform
