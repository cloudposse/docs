We need to decide on what methodology to use when deploying applications to ECS.

Think of Helm Charts in Kubernetes as similar to using Terraform Modules for ECS Tasks

#### Deploy using Spacelift

- Github action that triggers Spacelift run which runs atmos and terraform

- Spacelift makes use of rego policies

- Optional manual confirmation

#### Deploy using Github Actions without Spacelift

- Github action runs atmos and terraform directly

- Auto deploy on merges

- Auto deploy on manual cut releases
