<Intro>
  This setup guide will help you get started with [ecspresso](https://github.com/kayac/ecspresso). It features an example app, which demonstrates how your GitHub Actions work with your infrastructure repository.
</Intro>

| Steps                                                | Actions                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Create a repository from the Example App template | [cloudposse-examples/app-on-ecs](https://github.com/cloudposse-examples/app-on-ecs) |
| 2. Update and reapply `ecr`                          | `atmos terraform apply ecr -s core-use1-artifacts`                                |
| 3. Validate the environment configuration            | Click Ops                                                                         |
| 4. Create a GitHub PAT                               | Click Ops                                                                         |
| 5. Set all Example App repository secrets            | Click Ops                                                                         |
| 6. Deploy the shared ECS Task Definition S3 Bucket   | `atmos apply s3-bucket/ecs-tasks-mirror -s < YOUR STACK >`                        |
| 7. Deploy the example ECS services                   | `atmos workflow deploy/app-on-ecs -f quickstart/app/app-on-ecs`                   |

<Note title="Note">

We recommend moving all workflows with `ecspresso` and `workflow` **prefixes** to a shared workflow repository that can be used by the rest of your organization.

We do not recommend keeping all shared workflows in the same repository as in this example, because it defeats the reusability. We've included all workflows in the example app repositories to make it easier to follow along and document.

</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Create the Example App repository

    <Admonition type="info" title="Customer Requirement">
      This step requires access to the GitHub Organization. Customers will need to create this GitHub repository in Jumpstart engagements.
    </Admonition>

    Cloud Posse deploys an example application with this new repository. This is separate from the infrastructure repository
    and can be used as reference for future applications. Cloud Posse also maintains a public example of this app repository
    with [cloudposse/example-app-on-ecs](https://github.com/cloudposse/example-app-on-ecs/). This is a GitHub repository
    template, meaning it can be used to create new repositories with predefined content.

    <Steps>
      1. Create a new repository in your organization from the
        [cloudposse/example-app-on-ecs](https://github.com/cloudposse/example-app-on-ecs/) template.
      2. Choose any name for the repository. For example, we might call this repo
        `acme/example-app-on-ecs`.
      3. Grant Cloud Posse `admin` access to this repository.
      4. If necessary, install the self-hosted runner GitHub App to this new repository.
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Create Image and GitHub OIDC Access Roles for ECR

    The Example App will build and push an image to the ECR registry. Create that image with the `ecr` component if not
    already created. The Example App GitHub Workflows will also need to be able to access that registry, and to do so, we
    deploy GitHub OIDC roles with the same `ecr` component.

    Add the following snippet in addition to any other repositories or images already included in these lists:

    ```yaml
    components:
      terraform:
        ecr:
          vars:
            github_actions_allowed_repos:
              - acme/example-app-on-ecs
            # ECR must be all lowercase
            images:
              - acme/example-app-on-ecs
    ```

    Reapply the `ecr` component with the following:

    ```console
    atmos terraform apply ecr -s core-use1-artifacts
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Configure the Environment

    We use the [cloudposse/github-action-interface-environment](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-interface-environment)
    GitHub Composite Action to read environment configuration from a private location. By default, we use the infrastructure
    repository as that private location and save the configuration to `.github/environments/ecspresso.yaml`.

    This action stores metadata about the environments we want to deploy to. It is the binding glue between our GHA, GitHub
    environments, and our infrastructure. When this action is called, an `environment` input is passed in. We then look up
    in the map below information about that environment, that information is stored as an output to be used by the rest of
    the GitHub actions.

    <Admonition type="info" title="GitHub Composite Actions">
      For more on GitHub Composite Actions, please see the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action).
    </Admonition>

    Create or confirm the configuration in `.github/environments/ecspresso.yaml` in the `acme/infra-acme` repository now.

    If the file doesn't exist, here's the template:

    <Admonition title="GitHub OIDC Roles" type="info">
      The `role` defined in this configuration may not exist yet. This role will be created by the given `ecs-service`
      component with the GitHub OIDC mixin. Once completing the
      [Deploy the Example App ECS Service](#deploy-the-example-app-ecs-service) step, please verify this role is correct.
    </Admonition>

    Then the Example App, verify that the target environment is correct. This should be in the `.github/configs/environment.yaml` file in Example App repository.

    ```yaml
    ## file: .github/configs/environment.yaml

    # assumes the same organization
    environment-info-repo: infrastructure
    implementation_path: .github/environments
    implementation_file: ecspresso.yaml
    implementation_ref: main
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Create a GitHub PAT

    <Admonition type="info" title="Customer Requirement">
      This step requires access to the GitHub Organization. Customers will need to create this PAT in Jumpstart engagements.
    </Admonition>

    In order for the Example App workflows to read the private environment configuration, we need to pass a token to the
    Composite Action.

    <Steps>
      1. Create a fine-grained PAT. Please see
        [Creating a fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
      2. Name this PAT whatever you would like. We recommend calling it `PRIVATE_CONFIG_READ_ACCESS`
      3. Grant this PAT `read` permission on the `acme/infra-acme`
        repository:
          ```diff
          Repository
          + Contents: Read-only
          + Metadata: Read-only
          ```
      4. Upload this PAT to 1Password, and Cloud Posse will add it as a GitHub repository secret. Or you can create an
        organization secret now that you can reuse in future application repositories.
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Add the Example App Secrets

    The GitHub Action workflows expect a few GitHub Secrets to exist to build images in AWS ECR. Add each of the following
    secrets to the Example App repository:

    <dl>
      <dt>`PRIVATE_CONFIG_READ_ACCESS`</dt>
      <dd>This is the PAT we created above in <a href="#create-a-github-pat">Create a GitHub PAT</a>.</dd>

      <dt>`ECR_REGISTRY`</dt>
      <dd>This is your ECR Registry, such as `111111111111.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.</dd>

      <dt>`ECR_REGION`</dt>
      <dd>This is the AWS region where the `ecr` component is deployed. For example, `us-east-1`</dd>

      <dt>`ECR_IAM_ROLE`</dt>
      <dd>
        This is the GitHub OIDC role created by the `ecr` component for accessing the registry. For this organization, this would be `arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-use1-artifacts-ecr-gha`.
        Verify this value by checking the output of the `ecr` component.
      </dd>

      <dt>`GHA_SECRET_OUTPUT_PASSPHRASE`</dt>
      <dd>
        This is a random string used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive image names and tags. This can be anything.

        For example, generate this with the following:

        ```console
        openssl rand -base64 24
        ```
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Configure the S3 Mirror Bucket, if not already configured

    If you haven't already configured the S3 mirror bucket, deploy and configure the shared S3 bucket for ECS tasks definitions now. Follow the [ECS Partial Task Definitions guide](/layers/software-delivery/ecs-ecspresso/ecs-partial-task-definitions/#steps)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Deploy the Example App ECS Service

    Ensure you have stacks configured for the Example App in every stage of your platform.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Initial Build Image">
      This task definition uses the `latest` ECR image for the Example App, which is built by the CI steps of the release
      pipelines. However, that step hasn't been run yet!

      You will need to first trigger the `main-branch` CI steps for the Example App, ignore the failure in the deploy step,
      and then deploy these components.
    </Admonition>

    <details>
      <summary>Catalog entry for the Example App</summary>

    ```yaml

              ignore_changes_desired_count: true
              ignore_changes_task_definition: true
    ```

    </details>

    Finally, apply the `ecs-services/example-app-on-ecs` component to deploy the Example App ECS service.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/app-on-ecs" fileName="quickstart/app/app-on-ecs" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Triggering Workflows

Now that all requirements are in place, validate all workflows.

<Steps>
  1. ### Clone the Example App locally

      ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:acme/example-app-on-ecs.git
      ```

  2. ### Change the demo color in `main.go`

      ```go
      func main() {
        c := os.Getenv("COLOR")
        if len(c) == 0 {
          c = "red" // change this color to something else, such as "blue"
        }
      ```

  3. ### Create a Pull Request

     Creating a PR will trigger the CI build and test workflows and the QA cleanup workflows. Ensure these all pass successfully.

  4. ### Add the `deploy/qa1` label

     Adding this label will kickoff a new workflow to build and test once again and then deploy to the `qa1` environment.
     Ensure this workflow passes successfully and then validate the "Deployment URL" returned.

     <Note title="Private Endpoints">
       Private endpoints require the VPN. If you're deploying a private endpoint, connect to the VPN in order to access the
       deployment URL.
     </Note>

  5. ### Merge the Pull Request

     Merging the PR will trigger two different workflows. The Feature Branch workflow will be triggered to clean up and release the QA environment, and the Main Branch workflow will be triggered to deploy to `dev` and draft a release. Once both workflows pass, check that the QA environment is no longer active and then validate the dev URL. Finally, make sure a draft release was successfully created.

  6. ### Publish a Release

     Using the draft release created by the Main Branch workflow, click Edit and then Publish. This will kick off the Release workflow and deploy to `staging` and then to `prod`. Once this workflow finishes, validate both endpoints.

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Workflows with `ecspresso` and `workflow` **prefixes** should be moved to a shared workflow repository that can be used
by the rest of your organization.

## FAQ

### Adding Additional Applications

This setup is a one time setup. You can add as many applications as you want to your platform. You can also add as many
environments as you want to your platform.

To add additional applications:

<Steps>
  1. Ensure the `ecspresso` and `workflow` **prefixes** are moved to a shared workflow repository that can be used by the
    rest of your organization.
  2. Create a new repository from one of the example app templates.
  3. Create your Example app Configuration file in the new repository.
  4. Ensure your infrastructure is deployed.
