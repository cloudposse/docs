<Intro>
These pages document legacy approaches to self-hosted GitHub runners that we previously recommended. For new deployments, we recommend using [RunsOn](/layers/github-actions/runs-on/).
</Intro>

:::info Current Recommendation

**[RunsOn](/layers/github-actions/runs-on/)** is now our recommended approach for self-hosted GitHub runners. It provides:
- Zero infrastructure management
- Simple GitHub App installation
- Cost-effective pay-per-use pricing
- No Kubernetes required

The approaches documented here are preserved for organizations with existing deployments.
