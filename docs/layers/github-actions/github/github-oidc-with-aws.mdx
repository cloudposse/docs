# How to use GitHub OIDC with AWS

GitHub OIDC (OpenID Connect) for AWS refers to the integration between GitHub as an identity provider using OpenID Connect and AWS services. This integration allows users to use their GitHub credentials to authenticate and access AWS resources securely. By configuring GitHub as an OIDC provider in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), organizations can establish a federated identity model. This enables GitHub users to sign in to AWS using their GitHub credentials, streamlining access management and eliminating the need for separate AWS-specific usernames and passwords. The integration also provides a centralized way to manage access permissions and enables Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities, enhancing security and user experience in the AWS environment. Organizations can configure OIDC settings in AWS, including client IDs, client secrets, and the GitHub OIDC discovery URL, to establish a trust relationship between GitHub and AWS. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's recommended to check the official documentation of GitHub and AWS.

## OpenID Connect

OIDC is short for OpenID Connect and, like SAML, is a way to federate identities. Federating Identities is a fancy way of saying we trust a 3rd party (the OIDC provider) to handle two tasks:

1. Authentication: verify who the user is
2. Authorization: verify what the user has access to (claims)

You can think of this process as similar to arriving at an airport. You present your passport to airport personnel (authentication) so they can identify you along with your boarding pass (authorization claim) indicating you are authorized to pass through security and board a specific flight.

    browser ->>+ provider: Authenticate and Authorize (e.g. username/password)
    provider ->>+ client: AuthN Response with Token (JWT)
    client ->>+ client: Validate Token Signature
```

### Example

This is an example of OpenID connect with DataDog.

## GitHub OIDC and AWS

:::tip

The primary reason we want to use GitHub OIDC with AWS is so GitHub Actions can assume various AWS Roles without the need to store permanent credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in GitHub.

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
  participant aws as AWS API (Relying Party)
  participant gh as GitHub Action (Relying Party)
  participant oidc as GitHub OIDC Provider

  gh ->>+ oidc: Workflow Makes an AuthN Request
  oidc ->>+ gh: GitHub Returns a Token

  gh ->>+ aws: API Call
  aws ->>+ aws: Validate
  Note right of aws: AWS validates the token was signed by GitHub before<br/>issuing the temporary credentials
  aws ->>+ gh: Temporary Credentials
  Note right of aws: GitHub Action Workflow calls STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity,<br/>passing the token obtained from the GitHub OIDC provider<br/>and receives temporary AWS Credentials in return
```

## Implementation

1. Install the [GitHub OIDC Provider component](/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/) in each account where GitHub Actions Workflows will assume a role.
2. Create the role that GitHub Actions Workflows will assume
3. Configure the GitHub Actions Workflow to assume the role

### GitHub OIDC Provider Component

After deploying the [GitHub OIDC Provider component](/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/) into an account, you should see the Identity Provider in IAM in the AWS Web Console.

### GitHub OIDC Mixin Role and Policy

Use the mixin to grant GitHub the ability to assume a role for a specific component.

- Add the [GitHub OIDC Mixin](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/mixins/github-actions-iam-role) to any component that needs to generate an IAM Role for GitHub Actions
- Implement a custom IAM Policy with least privilege for the role. See [example policies here](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/mixins/github-actions-iam-policy)

### GitHub OIDC Role Component

Deploy the [GitHub OIDC Role component](/components/library/aws/github-oidc-role/) to create a generalized role for GitHub to access several resources in AWS.

### Configuring GitHub Action Workflows

First, give the GitHub Action Workflow the proper permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write # This is required for requesting the JWT
  contents: read  # This is required for actions/checkout
```

Then, use the official [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) action to automatically obtain a token from the GitHub OIDC provider, exchange that token for AWS temporary credentials and set the proper env vars in your GitHub Action Workflow

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-region: us-east-2
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/my-github-actions-role
    role-session-name: my-github-actions-role-session
```

## FAQ

### Should I use the Mixin or the component to deploy a GitHub OIDC role?

Use the mixin when deploying a role tightly coupled with a specific component. For example, use the mixin with `ecr` to grant GitHub access to push and pull ECR images.

However, sometimes we need a role with access to many components or resources. In this case, we use the `github-oidc-role` component to define a generalized role for GitHub to assume. For example, we use the component for the `gitops` role.
