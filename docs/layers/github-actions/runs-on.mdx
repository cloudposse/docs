<Intro>
  This guide explains how to set up and manage self-hosted runners using the Runs On component. Self-hosted runners provide more control over the execution environment, allowing you to run workflows on your own infrastructure.
</Intro>

<Admonition type="note">
  [GitHub-OIDC](/layers/github-actions/github-oidc-provider/) is not required to deploy Runs On, but it is required for several components to be deployed on or to via SelfHosted Runners.
  For example, your runners cannot push to ECR without GitHub-OIDC.
</Admonition>

<KeyPoints title="Quick Start">

1. Vendor the required components
2. Deploy the Runs On component
3. Install the GitHub App
4. Configure your workflows to use the runners

</KeyPoints>

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ## <StepNumber/> Vendor Runs On Component

  Vendor the required components using the included Atmos workflow:

  <AtmosWorkflow workflow="vendor" fileName="github" />

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ## <StepNumber/> Deploy Runs On Component

  Deploy the Runs On component using the included Atmos workflow:

  <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/runs-on" fileName="github" />

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ## <StepNumber/> Install GitHub App

  After deployment, follow these steps to install the GitHub App:

  1. Check the Terraform outputs for `RunsOnEntryPoint` 
  2. Use the provided URL to install the GitHub App 
  3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation in your GitHub Organization 
  4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in GitHub to install the app 

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### <StepNumber/> Configure Workflows

  Update your GitHub Actions workflow files to use the self-hosted runners:

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: 
        - "runs-on=${{ github.run_id }}"
        - "runner=terraform" # Note `terraform` is a runner group name defined by a RunsOn configuration
        ## If no configuraiton is present, use
        # - "runner=2cpu-linux-x64"
        ## Optional Tags
        # - "tag=${{ inputs.component }}-${{ inputs.stack }}"
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        # Add your build steps here
  ```

  For more information on available runner types and configurations, check the [RunsOn: Runner Types documentation](https://runs-on.com/runners/linux/).
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### <StepNumber/> (Optional) Setup a RunsOn Repo or Organization Configuration

    In your Repository you can add a file to configure Runs On. This can also extend the configuration for the Organization.

    <code>
      ```yaml
      # See https://runs-on.com/configuration/repo-config/
      _extends: .github
      terraform:
        cpu: [4, 32] # example override
      ```
    </code>
  } />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Action Runner Not Found

First determine if the Workflow or the Runner is the issue, sometimes the workflow doesn't kick off because it is on a feature branch and not on the default.

If the workflow kicks off but is waiting on a runner, checkout [Runs On Troubleshooting](https://runs-on.com/guides/troubleshoot/) as they have great docs on figuring out why a runner is not available.
