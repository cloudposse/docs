<Intro>
Frequently asked questions about managing AWS accounts with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.
</Intro>

### Why not use Control Tower?

AWS Control Tower cannot be managed with Terraform. Depending on the Scope of Work, Cloud Posse is usually responsible
for provisioning accounts with terraform which requires all the same access as Control Tower.

### Why are there so many accounts?

Leveraging multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization is the only way to satisfy IAM level isolation. Each account
has a very specific purpose, that all associated resources are isolated in that given account.

### How we can set budgets?

Create budgets with the `account-settings` component. For more, see
[the `account-settings` component documentation](/components/library/aws/account-settings/)

:::info

Budgets created for the `root` account apply to the AWS Organization as a whole

:::

### How do you add or remove Service Control Policies?

Service Control Policies are managed with the `account` component variable, `service_control_policies_config_paths`. For
more, see [the `account` component documentation](/components/library/aws/account/)

:::caution

This component manages the state of all AWS accounts, so apply with extreme caution!

### How can you create an Account?

[Follow the documentation for creating and setting up AWS Accounts](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-and-setup-aws-accounts/)

### How do you delete an Account?

[Follow the documentation for deleting AWS Accounts](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-delete-aws-accounts/)

### How can you create a Tenant?

[Follow the documentation for creating a new Organizational Unit](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-add-a-new-organizational-unit/)

### How do I use mixins and imports with Atmos

As infrastructure grows, we end up with hundreds or thousands of settings for components and stack configurations. If we
copy and paste these settings everywhere, it’s error-prone and not DRY. What we really want to do is to define a sane
set of defaults and override those defaults when we need them to change.

We accomplish this with Mixins. Mixins are imported into all stacks and each follow a set of rules. We use the
`mixins/region` and `mixins/account` configurations to define common **variables** for all stacks. For example,
`mixins/region/us-east-1.yaml` will define the variable `region: us-east-1`.

**Note.** Do not import components into the account or region mixins. These are imported multiple times to define common
variables, so any component imports would be duplicated and cause an Atmos error such as this:

```
Executing command:
/usr/bin/atmos terraform deploy account-settings -s core-gbl-artifacts

Found duplicate config for the component 'account-settings' for the stack 'core-gbl-artifacts' in the files: orgs/cch/core/artifacts/global-region/baseline, orgs/cch/core/artifacts/global-region/monitoring, orgs/cch/core/artifacts/global-region/identity.
Check that all context variables in the stack name pattern '{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}' are correctly defined in the files and not duplicated.
Check that all imports are valid.

exit status 1
```

### Why does `account-map` fail with "The given key does not identify an element in this collection value"?

This is a common error you may encounter when reading from `account-map`:

```bash
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

```

This error typically occurs when the `root_account_aws_name` is not correctly configured in the `account-map` component. The root account has two different names:

<Steps>
- **AWS Account Name**: The name you typed when originally creating the AWS account (often "root" but can be different)
- **Account Alias**: The deterministic name set in the account configuration (e.g., "core-root")
</Steps>

To fix this:

<Steps>
1. Find your root account name using AWS Organizations:
   ```bash
   aws organizations list-accounts \
     --query "Accounts[?Id=='$(aws organizations describe-organization --query 'Organization.MasterAccountId' --output text)'].Name" \
     --output text
   ```

2. Update `stacks/catalog/account-map.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   components:
     terraform:
       account-map:
         vars:
           root_account_aws_name: "your-actual-root-account-name"  # The name from step 1
           root_account_account_name: "core-root"  # This should always be "core-root"
   ```

3. Reapply the account-map:
   ```bash
   atmos terraform apply account-map -s core-gbl-root
   ```
</Steps>

For more details, see [the account deployment documentation](/layers/accounts/deploy-accounts/#confirm-root-account-name).
