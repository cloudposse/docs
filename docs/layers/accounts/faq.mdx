<Intro>
Frequently asked questions about managing AWS accounts with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.
</Intro>

### Why not use Control Tower?

AWS Control Tower cannot be managed with Terraform. Depending on the Scope of Work, Cloud Posse is usually responsible
for provisioning accounts with terraform which requires all the same access as Control Tower.

### Why are there so many accounts?

Leveraging multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization is the only way to satisfy IAM level isolation. Each account
has a very specific purpose, that all associated resources are isolated in that given account.

### How we can set budgets?

Create budgets with the `account-settings` component. For more, see
[the `account-settings` component documentation](/components/library/aws/account-settings/)

:::info

Budgets created for the `root` account apply to the AWS Organization as a whole

:::

### How do you add or remove Service Control Policies?

Service Control Policies are managed with the `account` component variable, `service_control_policies_config_paths`. For
more, see [the `account` component documentation](/components/library/aws/account/)

:::caution

This component manages the state of all AWS accounts, so apply with extreme caution!
