# Account Management

This chapter is intended to present how Cloud Posse has designed AWS Account architecture and management. We will
explain how Cloud Posse provisions and manages AWS Accounts, the reasoning behind our decisions, and how this
architecture will better align your organization with the
[AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/wellarchitected-ug.pdf)

## The Problem

The
[AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/wellarchitected-ug.pdf)
defines AWS architectural best practices and presents a set of foundational questions to enable you to understand how a
specific architecture aligns with cloud best practices.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides several foundational recommendations, one of which is to distribute
workloads across multiple AWS accounts. However, the framework does not prescribe how this should be achieved. AWS
offers resources such as Control Tower or Account Factory for provisioning accounts, but these resources have some
limitations. The primary issue is that they cannot be managed with Terraform, which means that manual effort is required
to use them.

## Our Solution

Cloud Posse has developed a set of components to provision, configure, and manage AWS Accounts and Organizations.

### Using an Organization

Leveraging multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization is the only way to satisfy these requirements. Guard rails
can be be in place to restrict what can happen in an account and by whom.

We then further organize the flat account structure into organizational units. Organizational units (OUs) can then
leverage things like Service Control Policies to restrict what can happen inside the accounts.

- **core**: Management accounts, such as the organizational root account or a network hub. This accounts are singletons
  and will never need to be duplicated.
- **plat**: Platform accounts, such as sandbox, dev, staging, and prod. These accounts are dynamic and can be specific
  to the needs of your Organizations.

### Account Boundaries

Constructs like VPCs only provide network-level isolation, but not IAM-level isolation. And within a single AWS account,
there’s no practical way to manage IAM-level boundaries between multiple stages like dev/staging/prod. For example, to
provision most Terraform modules, “administrative” level access is required because provisioning any IAM roles requires
admin privileges. That would mean that a developer needs to be an “admin” in order to iterate on a module.

Multiple AWS accounts should be used to provide a higher degree of isolation by segmenting/isolating workloads. There is
no additional cost for operating multiple AWS accounts. It does add additional overhead to manage as a standard set of
components will to manage the account. AWS Support only applies to one account, so it may need to be purchased for each
account unless the organization upgrades to Enterprise Support.

Multiple AWS accounts are all managed underneath an AWS Organization and organized into multiple organizational units
(OUs). Service Control Policies can restrict what runs in an account and place boundaries around an account that even
account-level administrators cannot bypass.

### Account Architecture

- `core-root`
  - The "root" (parent, billing) account creates all child accounts. The root account has special capabilities not found
    in any other account
  - An administrator in the `root` account by default has the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` to all other accounts
    (admin access)
  - Organizational CloudTrails can only be provisioned in this account. It’s the only account that can have member
    accounts associated with it
  - Service Control Policies can only be set in this account
  - It’s the only account that can manage the AWS Organization
- `core-audit`
  - The "audit" account is where all logs end up
- `core-security`
  - The "security" account is where to run automated security scanning software that might operate in a read-only
    fashion against the audit account.
- `core-identity`
  - The "identity" account is where to add users and delegate access to the other accounts and is where users log in
- `core-network`
  - The “network” account is where the transit gateway is managed and all inter-account routing
- `core-dns`
  - The “dns” account is the owner for all zones (may have a legal role with `Route53Registrar.*` permissions). Cannot
    touch zones or anything else. Includes billing.
- `core-auto`
  - The “automation” account is where any gitops automation will live. Some automation (like Spacelift) has “god” mode
    in this account. The auto account will typically have transit gateway access to all other accounts, therefore we
    want to limit what is deployed in the automation account to only those services which need it.
- `core-artifacts`
  - This “artifacts” account is where we recommend centralizing and storing artifacts (e.g. ECR, assets, etc) for CI/CD
- `plat-prod`
  - The "production" is the account where you run your most mission-critical applications
- `plat-staging`
  - The “staging” account is where QA and integration tests will run for public consumption.
  - This is production for QA engineers and partners doing integration tests. It must be stable for third-parties to
    test. It runs a kubernetes cluster.
- `plat-dev`
  - The "dev" account is where to run automated tests, load tests infrastructure code.
  - This is where the entire engineering organization operates daily. It needs to be stable for developers. This
    environment is Production for developers to develop code.
- `plat-sandbox`
  - The "sandbox" account is where you let your developers have fun and break things. Developers get admin. This is
    where changes happen first. It will be used by developers who need the bleeding edge. Only DevOps work here or
    developers trying to get net-new applications added to tools like slice.

#### Terraform State

We need someplace to store the terraform state. Multiple options exist (e.g. Vault, Terraform Enterprise, GitLab,
Spacelift), but the only one we’ll focus on right now is using S3. The terraform state may contain secrets, which is
unavoidable for certain kinds of resources (e.g. master credentials for RDS clusters). For this reason, it is advisable
for companies with security and compliance requirements to segment their state backends to make it easier to control
with IAM who has access to what.

While on the other hand adding multiple state backends is good from a security perspective, on the other it
unnecessarily complicates the architecture for companies that do not need the added layer of security.

We will use a single S3 bucket, as it is the least complicated to maintain. Anyone who should be able to run terraform
locally will need read/write access to this state bucket.

### Implementation

Cloud Posse manages this process with the following components.

- [`account`](/components/library/aws/account/): This component is responsible for provisioning the full account
  hierarchy along with Organizational Units (OUs). It includes the ability to associate Service Control Policies (SCPs)
  to the Organization, each Organizational Unit and account.
- [`account-settings`](/components/library/aws/account-settings/): This component is responsible for provisioning
  account level settings: IAM password policy, AWS Account Alias, EBS encryption, and Service Quotas. We can also
  leverage this component to enable account or organization level budgets.
- [`account-map`](/components/library/aws/account-map/): Transforms account metadata to a safe place for all designated
  roles to able to access. IAM roles should not able to read `account`. Once `account-map` is provisioned, other
  components can utilized `remote-state` to pull account metadata such as Account ID mapping or IAM Roles to assume for
  a given account.
- [`account-quotas`](/components/library/aws/account-quotas/): This component is responsible for requesting service
  quota increases. We recommend making requests here rather than in `account-settings` because `account-settings` is a
  restricted component that can only be applied by SuperAdmin.
- [`tfstate-backend`](/components/library/aws/tfstate-backend/): Provisions the Terraform state backends. This component
  already follows all standard best practices around private ACLs, encryption, versioning, locking, etc.
- [`cloudtrail`](/components/library/aws/cloudtrail/): This component is responsible for provisioning cloudtrail
  auditing in an individual account. It's expected to be used alongside the cloudtrail-bucket component as it utilizes
  that bucket via remote state.
- [`cloudtrail-bucket`](/components/library/aws/cloudtrail-bucket/): This component is responsible for provisioning a
  bucket for storing cloudtrail logs for auditing purposes

## FAQ

### Why not use Control Tower?

AWS Control Tower cannot be managed with Terraform. Depending on the Scope of Work, Cloud Posse is usually responsible
for provisioning accounts with terraform which requires all the same access as Control Tower.

### Why are there so many accounts?

Leveraging multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization is the only way to satisfy IAM level isolation. Each account
has a very specific purpose, that all associated resources are isolated in that given account.

### How we can set budgets?

Create budgets with the `account-settings` component. For more, see
[the `account-settings` component documentation](/components/library/aws/account-settings/)

:::info

Budgets created for the `root` account apply to the AWS Organization as a whole

:::

### How do you add or remove Service Control Policies?

Service Control Policies are managed with the `account` component variable, `service_control_policies_config_paths`. For
more, see [the `account` component documentation](/components/library/aws/account/)

:::caution

This component manages the state of all AWS accounts, so apply with extreme caution!

### Mixins and Imports with Atmos

As infrastructure grows, we end up with hundreds or thousands of settings for components and stack configurations. If we
copy and paste these settings everywhere, it’s error-prone and not DRY. What we really want to do is to define a sane
set of defaults and override those defaults when we need them to change.

We accomplish this with Mixins. Mixins are imported into all stacks and each follow a set of rules. We use the
`mixins/region` and `mixins/account` configurations to define common **variables** for all stacks. For example,
`mixins/region/us-east-1.yaml` will define the variable `region: us-east-1`.

**Note.** Do not import components into the account or region mixins. These are imported multiple times to define common
variables, so any component imports would be duplicated and cause an Atmos error such as this:

```
Executing command:
/usr/bin/atmos terraform deploy account-settings -s core-gbl-artifacts

Found duplicate config for the component 'account-settings' for the stack 'core-gbl-artifacts' in the files: orgs/cch/core/artifacts/global-region/baseline, orgs/cch/core/artifacts/global-region/monitoring, orgs/cch/core/artifacts/global-region/identity.
Check that all context variables in the stack name pattern '{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}' are correctly defined in the files and not duplicated.
Check that all imports are valid.

exit status 1
```
