<Intro>
Now that all the accounts have been deployed, we need to finalize the setup of the accounts. This includes deploying CloudTrail and optionally account budgets. These foundational components will be necessary to move forward with the rest of the deployment.
</Intro>

| Steps                      | Actions                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Deploy baseline components | `atmos workflow deploy -f quickstart/foundation/baseline` |
| Deploy account budgets     | Create Slack Webhook and `atmos workflow deploy -f quickstart/foundation/accounts` |

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ## <StepNumber/> Deploy CloudTrail

  Deploy CloudTrail and the the CloudTrail bucket:

      <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/cloudtrail" fileName="quickstart/foundation/baseline" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ## <StepNumber/> (Optional) Deploy Account Budgets

  Budgets are an optional feature that can be enabled with [the `account-settings` component](/components/library/aws/account-settings/) for the Organization as a whole or for individual accounts. Budgets *do not restrict spending* but provide visibility into spending and can be used to set alerts when spending exceeds a certain threshold. We recommend using a dedicated Slack channel for these alerts, which we will set up with a webhook.

  <Steps>
  1. [Create a Slack Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). Take note of the Webhook URL and the final name of the Slack channel. The Slack channel is case-sensitive and needs to match the name of the channel exactly as the name appears in owning Slack server (not the name if changed as a shared channel).
  2. Update the `account-settings` component with the Slack Webhook URL and the Slack channel name.
     ```yaml
     # stacks/catalog/account-settings.yaml
     components:
       terraform:
         account-settings:
           vars:
             budgets_enabled: true
             budgets_notifications_enabled: true
             budgets_slack_webhook_url: https://url.slack.com/abcd/1234
             budgets_slack_username: AWS Budgets
             budgets_slack_channel: aws-budgets-notifications
     ```
  3. **Enable Cost Explorer** (if not already enabled). When attempting to create budgets, you may encounter the following error:

  ```console
  Error: creating Budget (xxx-core-gbl-artifacts-1000-total-monthly): operation error Budgets: CreateBudget, 
  https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: xxx, 
  AccessDeniedException: Account xxx is a linked account. To enable budgets for your account, ask the payer account to enable budgets first.
  ```

  This error occurs when AWS Cost Explorer has not been activated for the organization. To resolve this, navigate to the AWS Cost Explorer console in your organization's management account and verify that Cost Explorer is enabled. Cost Explorer must be enabled at the organization level before individual member accounts can create budgets.

  4. **To enable budgets for the entire organization**, update `account-settings` in the same account as the Organization root account, typically `core-root`. This budget will include the total spending of all accounts in the Organization.
     ```yaml
     # stacks/orgs/acme/core/root/global-region/baseline.yaml
     import:
       - catalog/account-settings

     components:
       terraform:
         account-settings:
           vars:
             # Budgets in `root` apply to the Organization as a whole
             budgets:
               - name: Total AWS Organization Cost per Month
                 budget_type: COST
                 limit_amount: 10000
                 limit_unit: USD
                 time_unit: MONTHLY
                 notification:
                   - comparison_operator: GREATER_THAN
                     notification_type: FORECASTED
                     threshold_type: PERCENTAGE
                     threshold: 80
                     subscribers:
                       - slack
                   - comparison_operator: GREATER_THAN
                     notification_type: FORECASTED
                     threshold_type: PERCENTAGE
                     threshold: 100
                     subscribers:
                       - slack
                   - comparison_operator: GREATER_THAN
                     notification_type: ACTUAL
                     threshold_type: PERCENTAGE
                     threshold: 100
                     subscribers:
                       - slack
     ```
  5. **To enable budgets for individual accounts**, update `account-settings` in the account you want to enable budgets for or as the default setting for all `account-settings` components to apply to every account. This budget will include the spending of the given account only.
     ```yaml
     # stacks/catalog/account-settings.yaml
     components:
     terraform:
       account-settings:
         vars:
           ...
           budgets:
             - name: 1000-total-monthly
               budget_type: COST
               limit_amount: "1000"
               limit_unit: USD
               time_unit: MONTHLY
             - name: s3-3GB-limit-monthly
               budget_type: USAGE
               limit_amount: "3"
               limit_unit: GB
               time_unit: MONTHLY
     ```
  6. Finally, reapply `account-settings` in any changed account to apply the new settings
     <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/account-settings" fileName="quickstart/foundation/accounts" />
  </Steps>
  </Step>
