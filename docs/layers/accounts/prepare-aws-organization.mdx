:::tip Cold Start

The set up process for the "baseline" or "account" tier is commonly referred to as the Cold Start.

:::

The Cold Start is the most manually involved tier. Read through the following steps and see [the detailed documentation](/layers/accounts/tutorials/manual-configuration/) for edge cases.

In short, the steps are...

| Steps                     | Actions                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Install requirements      |                                     |
| Build Geodesic            | `make all`                          |
| Vendor components         | `atmos workflow vendor -f baseline` |
| Configure root SuperAdmin | Click Ops                           |

## Prerequisites

Follow the [prerequisites steps in the How-to Get Started guide](/layers/project/#0-prerequisites).

Start your Geodesic shell before continuing.


## Before Running Terraform (ClickOps)

First, you'll need to perform some ClickOps to ensure things are set up before we use Terraform to manage AWS accounts.

From the root account:

<Steps>
1. ### Get Business Class Support
   Enable [business support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_support.html) in
   the `root` account (in order to expedite requests to raise the AWS member account limits)
1. ### Set up MFA on Root Account
   Set up up the Virtual MFA device on the root account, following
   [the instructions in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root) for enabling a virtual MFA device for an AWS account root user. Save the MFA TOTP key in 1Password by using
   1Password's TOTP field and built-in screen scanner to scan the QR code presented on the web page.
1. ### Create the `SuperAdmin` IAM User
   [Create a `SuperAdmin` IAM User](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/). Do not enable "console
   login", do set up MFA, and then create a single Access key. Create an API Credential for the `SuperAdmin` credentials
   in 1Password and store the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Assigned MFA device ARN, and TOTP key. This is the user
   we will use until AWS Team Roles (`aws-team-roles` component) are provisioned.
1. ### Enable IAM Access for Billing
   For billing users, you need to enable IAM access. As the root user
   [open up the account settings for AWS Billing](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-east-1#/Account),
   then scroll to the section "IAM user and role access to Billing information" and enable it.
3. ### Enable Regions (Optional)
   The 17 original AWS regions are enabled by default. If you are using a region that is not enabled by default (such as Middle East/Bahrain), you need to take extra steps. For details, see [the detailed documentation](/layers/accounts/tutorials/manual-configuration/#optional-enable-regions)
