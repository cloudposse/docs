The Cold Start involves more manual steps than other layers. Read through the following steps carefully.

The set up process for the "baseline" or "account" layer is commonly referred to as the Cold Start.

## Before Running Terraform (ClickOps)

First, you'll need to perform some ClickOps to ensure things are set up before we use Terraform to manage AWS accounts.

From the root account:

<Steps>
1. ### Get Business Class Support
   Enable [business support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_support.html) in
   the `root` account (in order to expedite requests to raise the AWS member account limits)
1. ### Set up MFA on Root Account
   Set up the Virtual MFA device on the root account following [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root).
   <Steps>
   1. Navigate to the root account's security credentials
   1. Set up a Virtual MFA device
   1. Save the MFA TOTP key in 1Password using 1Password's TOTP field and built-in screen scanner to scan the QR code
   </Steps>
1. ### Create the `SuperAdmin` IAM User
   [Create a `SuperAdmin` IAM User](/layers/accounts/tutorials/how-to-create-superadmin-user/). This is the user we will use until IAM Identity Center is provisioned.
   <Steps>
   1. Create the IAM user (do not enable "console login")
   1. Set up MFA for the user
   1. Create a single Access Key
   1. Store credentials in 1Password: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Assigned MFA device ARN, and TOTP key
   </Steps>
1. ### Enable IAM Access for Billing
   For billing users, you need to enable IAM access to billing information.
   <Steps>
   1. As the root user, open [AWS Billing Account Settings](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-east-1#/Account)
   1. Scroll to "IAM user and role access to Billing information"
   1. Enable IAM access
   </Steps>
1. ### Enable Centralized Root Access
   Enable centralized root access management to eliminate the need for per-account root credentials. This allows the management account to perform privileged root operations on member accounts without maintaining separate root passwords or MFA devices.
   <Steps>
   1. Navigate to [IAM → Root access management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/root-access-management)
   1. Enable **Root credentials management**
   1. Enable **Privileged root actions**
   </Steps>
   For more details, see [Centralized Root Access](/layers/identity/centralized-root-access/).
1. ### Enable Regions (Optional)
   The 17 original AWS regions are enabled by default. If you are using a region that is not enabled by default (such as Middle East/Bahrain), you need to [enable it in your AWS account settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html).
1. ### Prepare for Account Quota Increase
   In order to deploy all accounts, you need to request an increase of the Account Quota from AWS support. This requires an AWS Organization to be created first, which we will create with Terraform in the [Deploy Accounts guide](/layers/accounts/deploy-accounts/#-prepare-account-deployment). This request can take a few days to process, so it's important to get it started early so that it doesn't become a blocker.

   At this time we don't need to request the increase, but we should be prepared to do so as soon as the AWS Organization is created.

</Steps>

<ActionCard title="Next Steps">
  Now that your AWS Organization is prepared with MFA, SuperAdmin credentials, and billing access configured,
  you're ready to initialize the Terraform state backend that will store all infrastructure state.
