<Intro>
Sometimes provisioning a new account and migrating resources isn’t an option. Adopting a legacy account into your new organization allows you to manage new resources using Atmos and Terraform while leaving old ones unmanaged. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for importing legacy AWS accounts into the Infrastructure Monorepo, updating account configurations, and integrating with Atmos and Spacelift for automation.
</Intro>

## Problem

Legacy AWS accounts may be owned by an organization (the company, not the AWS organization) but not part of the AWS
Organization provisioned by the Infrastructure Monorepo via Atmos. This process is meant to “adopt” or “import” the
accounts in question for use with the Infrastructure Monorepo, so that their infrastructure may be automated via Atmos and Spacelift.

## Solution

:::caution

When you remove a member account from an Organization, the member account’s access to AWS services that are integrated
with the Organization are lost. In some cases, resources in the member account might be deleted. For example, when an
account leaves the Organization, the AWS CloudFormation stacks created using StackSets are removed from the management
of StackSets. You can choose to either delete or retain the resources managed by the stack. For a list of AWS services
that can be integrated with Organizations, see [AWS services that you can use with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html). ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/organizations-move-accounts/))

:::

:::tip

Legacy AWS Accounts must be invited to the AWS Organization managed by the Infrastructure Monorepo, and imported into
the `account` component. From there, the Geodesic image and the Atmos stacks must be updated to reflect the presence of
the new accounts.

:::

### Invite the AWS Account(s) Into the Organization Managed by the Infrastructure Monorepo

Before the AWS account(s) can be managed by Terraform + Atmos in the Infrastructure Monorepo, they need to invited to
the AWS Organization managed by the Infrastructure Monorepo.

From the management account (usually named `root` or `mgmt-root`), navigate to `AWS Organizations` → `AWS Accounts` →
`Add an AWS Account` → `Invite an existing AWS account`. Enter the ID of the AWS account that is to be invited, then
`Send Invitation`.

This step does **not** have to be done (and in terms of best-practices **should not** be done) via the root user. It can
be done via an assumed role provisioned by `iam-delegated-roles` that has the `organizations:DescribeOrganization` and
`organizations:InviteAccountToOrganization` permissions — i.e. the `admin` delegated role.

The email address of the management account must be verified, if not already done so. Otherwise, the invitation cannot
be sent.

An email will be sent to the email address(es) associated with the AWS account(s) in question. The link leads to the AWS
console where the invitation can be accepted or denied. Once again, this step does **not** have to be done (and in terms
of best-practices **should not** be done) via the root user. However, since this is a legacy account, it does not have
the roles deployed by `iam-delegated-roles`. Thus, ensure that the assumed role used to accept the invitation has the
`organizations:ListHandshakesForAccount`, `organizations:AcceptHandshake` and `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permissions,
for example via the built-in `AdministratorAccess` policy.

### Add the Account(s) to the `account` Component Configuration

:::info

The OU that you are adding the legacy AWS accounts to needs to be adjusted to match your business use case. Some
organizations may choose to employ a “legacy” OU. Others, as in the example below, have an OU for each “tenant” within
the organization, and legacy AWS accounts will live alongside current AWS accounts within a single OU.

:::

Your existing `account` component configuration should look something like this:

```

```

Entries corresponding to the legacy AWS accounts need to be added before the accounts can be imported:

```
...
                - name: core-legacydev
                  stage: dev
                  tenant: core
                  tags:
                    eks: true
                - name: core-legacystaging
                  stage: staging
                  tenant: core
                  tags:
                    eks: true
                - name: core-legacyprod
                  stage: prod
                  tenant: core
                  tags:
                    eks: true
...
```

Once entries are created, a Terraform plan can be run against the `account` component when assuming the `admin`
delegated role in `mgmt-root`:

:::caution

If the Terraform plan attempts to destroy the newly-added legacy account, do not apply it! See section on working around
destructive Terraform plans for newly-added legacy accounts.

:::

```
√ : [eg-mgmt-gbl-root-admin] (HOST) infrastructure ⨠ atmos terraform plan account -s mgmt-gbl-root
```

```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

##### Workaround for Destructive Terraform Plans for Legacy Accounts

Terraform will sometimes try to destroy a legacy account because the `iam_user_access_to_billing` attribute is not
modifiable via Terraform (or the AWS CLI, for that matter):

[https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/12959](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/12959)

[https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/12585](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/12585)

[https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/6252](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/6252)

The workaround for this is to edit the `iam_user_access_to_billing` attribute manually in the Terraform state:

1. Download the Terraform state locally in Geodesic via
   `assume-role aws s3 cp s3://eg-mgmt-ue1-root-admin-tfstate/account/mgmt-root/terraform.tfstate ./terraform.tfstate`

2. Find the `iam_user_access_to_billing` attribute for the account in question and change it to either `ENABLE` or
   `DENY`, depending on whether or not IAM access to billing is enabled for the account in question. Ensure that the
   value inputted into the state manually reflects the actual state of the AWS account in question.

<img src="/assets/refarch/cleanshot-2022-01-23-at-17.34.32@2x-20220123-154819.png" /><br/>

Overwrite the Terraform state via
`assume-role aws s3 cp --sse AES256 ./terraform.tfstate s3://eg-mgmt-ue1-root-admin-tfstate/account/mgmt-root/terraform.tfstate`.

1. Run the same Terraform plan and copy the expected MD5 digest for the Terraform state.

<img src="/assets/refarch/cleanshot-2022-01-23-at-17.52.48@2x-20220123-155328.png" /><br/>

2. In DynamoDB, find the MD5 digest item for the Terraform state for the workspace in question (e.g. `mgmt-root` in
   `eg-mgmt-ue1-root`) and overwrite the current digest value with the expected digest value.

### Import Legacy AWS Account(s) Into the `account` Component Workspace and Update Legacy Account Attributes

Using the resources address from the Terraform plan, the AWS account(s) can now be imported:

```
$ cd components/terraform/account
$ terraform import 'aws_organizations_account.organizational_units_accounts["core-legacydev"]' 123456789024
$ terraform import 'aws_organizations_account.organizational_units_accounts["core-legacystaging"]' 123456789025
$ terraform import 'aws_organizations_account.organizational_units_accounts["core-legacyprod"]' 123456789026
```

Once the legacy accounts have been imported to the `account` component workspace, their attributes can be updated by
running a Terraform apply.

```
$ cd ../../../ # go back to the root of the infrastructure monoorepo
$ atmos terraform plan account -s mgmt-gbl-root
... # verify that there are no destructive changes, and that all of the intended attributes are correct, especially the email address associated with each account
$ atmos terraform apply account -s mgmt-gbl-root
```

### Update Geodesic Image

The Geodesic container image contains an `aws-accounts` script that is responsible for creating the AWS CLI profile used
within the image both by users and Spacelift. It needs to be updated to reflect the newly-added AWS accounts.

The existing `rootfs/usr/local/bin/aws-accounts` script should have a section with an associative array representing the
account names and their IDs, and a list representing the order of profiles corresponding to each AWS account:

```
...

declare -A accounts
# root account intentionally omitted
accounts=(
  [mgmt-artifacts]="123456789012"
  [mgmt-audit]="123456789013"
  [mgmt-automation]="123456789014"
  [mgmt-corp]="123456789015"
  [mgmt-dns]="123456789016"
  [mgmt-identity]="123456789017"
  [mgmt-network]="123456789018"
  [mgmt-sandbox]="123456789019"
  [mgmt-security]="123456789020"
  [core-dev]="123456789021"
  [core-prod]="123456789022"
  [core-staging]="123456789023"
)

# When choosing a profile, the users will be presented with a
# list of profiles in this order
readonly profile_order=(
  mgmt-artifacts
  mgmt-audit
  mgmt-automation
  mgmt-corp
  mgmt-dns
  mgmt-identity
  mgmt-network
  mgmt-sandbox
  mgmt-security
  mgmt-root
  core-dev
  core-prod
  core-staging
)

...
```

Both the associative array and the list need to be updated to reflect the newly added legacy AWS accounts:

```
...

declare -A accounts
# root account intentionally omitted
accounts=(
...
  [core-legacydev]="123456789024"
  [core-legacyprod]="123456789025"
  [core-legacystaging]="123456789026"
)

# When choosing a profile, the users will be presented with a
# list of profiles in this order
readonly profile_order=(
...
  core-legacydev
  core-legacyprod
  core-legacystaging
)

...
```

The script then needs to be re-run to update both the local AWS CLI config and the versioned CI/CD AWS CLI config:

```
$ aws-accounts config-saml >> ~/.aws/config
$ aws-accounts config-cicd > rootfs/etc/aws-config/aws-config-cicd # (and commit this change upstream)
```

### Add and Deploy Atmos Stacks for Newly-added Legacy AWS Accounts

Once the Geodesic image has been updated, global and regional stacks for the newly-added legacy accounts need to be
added. These stacks should also contain core components for the newly-added accounts.

```
...
core-gbl-legacydev.yaml
core-gbl-legacyprod.yaml
core-gbl-legacystaging.yaml
core-uw2-legacydev.yaml
core-uw2-legacyprod.yaml
core-uw2-legacystaging.yaml
...
```

The global stacks should contain the `iam-delegated-roles` and `dns-delegated` components:

```
import:
  - core-gbl-globals
  - catalog/iam-delegated-roles
  - catalog/dns-delegated

vars:
  stage: legacydev

terraform:
  vars: {}

components:
  terraform:
    dns-delegated:
      vars:
        zone_config:
          - subdomain: legacydev
            zone_name: core.acme-infra.net
```

The regional stacks should contain `dns-delegated` and `vpc` components:

```
import:
  - core-uw2-globals
  - catalog/dns-delegated
  - catalog/vpc

vars:
  stage: legacydev

terraform:
  vars: {}

helmfile:
  vars: {}

components:
  terraform:
    dns-delegated:
      vars:
        zone_config:
          - subdomain: uw2.legacydev
            zone_name: core.acme-infra.net
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: 172.2.0.0/18 # change this to the VPC CIDR block in the legacy account
```

The `vpc` component will need to have the existing VPC in the legacy account imported to the component’s workspace:

```
$ atmos terraform plan vpc -s core-uw2-legacydev
... # copy resource ID of VPC
$ cd components/terraform/vpc
$ terraform import ... # import VPC and subnets
```

Once the stacks are added, deploy the following components:

:::info

If AWS SSO is being used via the `aws-sso` component, the configuration of the aforementioned component needs to be
updated in order to configure permission sets for the newly added accounts. Then, the component needs to be redeployed.

:::

- `account-map` (in `mgmt-gbl-root`)

- `iam-primary-roles` (in `mgmt-gbl-identity`)

- `iam-delegated-roles` (in each new global stack)

- `dns-delegated` (in each new global and regional stack)

- `vpc` (in each new regional stack)

- `compliance` (if being used)

### Validate Access

:::info

Existing AWS Accounts invited to an AWS organization lack the OrganizationAccountAccessRole IAM role created
automatically when creating the account with the AWS Organizations service. The role grants admin permissions to the
member account to delegated IAM users in the master account.

Thus the
[https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-organization-access-role](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-organization-access-role)
module should be leveraged as part of the `account-settings` component in order to deploy this IAM role.

:::

Finally, validate access to the newly-added legacy accounts via the delegated IAM roles by signing into the AWS console
and also running `assume-role eg-core-gbl-legacydev-admin aws sts get-caller-identity` (for each newly added account)
within Geodesic.
