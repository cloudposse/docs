Make sure to use the email address corresponding to the
[Decide on Email Address Format for AWS Accounts](/learn/foundation/design-decisions/decide-on-email-address-format-for-aws-accounts)
ADR.

:::

There should exist an `[organization]-aws-notifications` Slack channel dedicated for emails addressed to the dedicated
AWS address, e.g. `aws@[domain]`. Cloud Posse recommends using `+` addressing, such that all AWS accounts will have
their account email set to be `aws+[account name]@[domain]`. Once emails addressed to `aws@[domain]` are set up to be
routed to this Slack channel's email address, all emails addressed to any of the AWS accounts' emails will appear in
this channel, thanks to the use of `+` addressing.

If the use of `+` addressing is not possible, a dedicated email address such as `aws.[account name]@[domain]` can be set
up for each AWS account, and a routing rule for each of these addresses to the AWS Notifications Slack channel's email
address can be created.

The following is an example of how to set up this channel and configure email routing to the dedicated Slack channel's
email address:

1. **Create the shared Slack channel (under Slack Connect):** (see also:
   [How to Provision Shared Slack Channels](/reference/how-to-provision-shared-slack-channels/) )

2. **Generate the Slack channel's email address (at the top of the newly-created Slack channel):**

3. **Set up email forwarding (example: G Suite / Google Workspace) in**
   `Google Workspace -> Settings for Gmail -> Routing -> Recipient address map`**:**
