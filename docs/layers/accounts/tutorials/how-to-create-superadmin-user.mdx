<Intro>
The `SuperAdmin` user is an IAM user created for cold start bootstrapping and emergency break-glass access only. This guide outlines the steps to create a secure `SuperAdmin` user in AWS, including setting permissions, enabling MFA, and storing credentials safely in 1Password.
</Intro>

## About SuperAdmin

The `SuperAdmin` user is a break-glass IAM user intended for two scenarios:

<Steps>
1. **Cold start bootstrapping** — Initial account setup before IAM Identity Center is configured
1. **Emergency IdP failure** — When your Identity Provider is completely unavailable and you cannot authenticate via IAM Identity Center
</Steps>

After cold start is complete, prefer these alternatives:

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Administrative tasks in a specific account | Use `AdministratorAccess` Permission Set for that account |
| Organization-level or emergency administrative tasks | Use [Centralized Root Access](/layers/identity/centralized-root-access/) via the `RootAccess` Permission Set |
| Emergency access (IdP down) | `SuperAdmin` (this is the only valid use case post-cold-start) |

Because `SuperAdmin` is an IAM user with static credentials, there is no audit trail for *who* used the credentials—all access appears as the same user. Permission Sets provide per-user audit trails via CloudTrail, making them the preferred option whenever your IdP is available.

    ### <StepNumber/> Create the SuperAdmin User

    First, create the SuperAdmin IAM user in the AWS web console.

    <Steps>
      1. Login to the AWS `root` account using the root credentials.

      1. In the IAM console, select "Users" on the sidebar.
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-181056.png" />

      1. Click "Add users" button
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-181130.png" />
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-181200.png" />

      1. Enter "SuperAdmin" for "User name" and check "Programmatic access" and leave "AWS Management Console access" unchecked. Click "Next: Permissions"
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-181251.png" />

      1. Under "Set permissions", select "Attach existing policies directly". A list should appear, from which you should check "AdministratorAccess". Click "Next: Tags"
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-181512.png" />

      1. Skip the tags, Click "Next: Review"

      1. Review and click "Create user"

      1. The Success page should show you the "Access key ID" and hidden "Secret access key" which can be revealed by clicking "Show". Copy these to your secure credentials storage as you will need them shortly
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-181626.png" />

      1. Click "Close" to return to the IAM console. Select "Users" on the sidebar if it is not already selected. You should see a list of users. Click the user name "SuperAdmin" (which should be a hyperlink) to take you to the Users -> SuperAdmin "Summary" page
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-182019.png" />

      1. On the "Users -> SuperAdmin" "Summary" page, click on the "Security credentials" tab

      1. In the "Sign-in credentials" section, find: "Assigned MFA device: Not assigned | Manage" and click "Manage"
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-182257.png" />

      1. Choose "Virtual MFA device" and click "Continue"
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-182421.png" />

      1. Press the "Show secret key" button
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210721-151123.png" />

      1. Copy the key into 1Password as a AWS Credential using the "MFA" field
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210721-151429.png" />

      1. Use the MFA codes from 1Password to complete the MFA setup process (you will input 2 consecutive codes)
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210721-151622.png" />

      1. You should be taken back to the "Security Credentials" tab, but now the "Assigned MFA device" field should have an ARN like `arn:aws:iam::<account-number>:mfa/SuperAdmin`
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20210720-182914.png" />

      1. Copy the ARN and keep it with the Access Key in 1Password

      1. Now we need to create an Access Key for CLI access. Click on the "Create Access Key" under "Access Keys"

      1. Select "Command Line Interface" and click the "I understand..." checkbox then click 'Next'

      1. Enter a description if you like, such as 'SuperAdmin CLI Access' and click 'Create'
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Store SuperAdmin Credentials in 1Password

    The `SuperAdmin` credentials should be properly stored in 1Password. Relative to other potential 1Password item types, the most appropriate 1Password item type for these credentials is `login`. Since these are programmatic credentials and not an actual login with an endpoint from which the website favicon can be retrieved. Additionally, the password field should be kept empty. For convenience in retrieving the TOTP code when using Leapp, save `com.leapp.app` as a website URL.

    <Steps>
      1. Set the username to `SuperAdmin`
      1. Create fields for the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and the TOTP (known as One Time Password field type in 1password) via the AWS virtual MFA device's secret
      1. Add a note in the following format:

         ```
         This account's Access Key should be made inactive when not needed.

         CURRENT STATUS: ACTIVE

         Use this account for API/command line access to administrative functions that IAM roles cannot do, such as provision IAM roles.

         This account should not be allowed to log in to the AWS console, and therefore does not have a password.

         Root account ID: [AWS ACCOUNT ID]

         User ARN arn:aws:iam::[AWS ACCOUNT ID]:user/SuperAdmin

         MFA Device ARN arn:aws:iam::[AWS ACCOUNT ID]:mfa/SuperAdmin
         ```

         The resulting entry in 1password should appear as follows:
         <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20211016-220615.png" />

      1. Hit save once you are done. Once the SuperAdmin credentials need to be disabled, do not forget to update the notes in this item
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>
