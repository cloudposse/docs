<Intro>
Now that all the accounts have been deployed, we need to deploy CloudTrail for audit logging. This foundational component provides visibility into API activity across your AWS Organization.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy CloudTrail

    Deploy CloudTrail and the CloudTrail bucket to enable audit logging across your organization:

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/cloudtrail" fileName="quickstart/foundation/baseline" />

    This workflow deploys:
    - **CloudTrail bucket** in `core-audit` — Centralized S3 bucket for storing CloudTrail logs
    - **Organization CloudTrail** in `core-root` — Organization-wide trail that captures API activity from all accounts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auditing CloudTrail Logs

## What's Next?

With CloudTrail deployed, you have completed the accounts layer. The next step is to configure identity and access management.

  Now that your accounts are deployed with audit logging enabled, you're ready to set up identity management with IAM Identity Center.
