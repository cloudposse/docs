<Intro>
Follow these steps to configure and initialize the Terraform state backend using Atmos, ensuring proper setup of the infrastructure components and state management.
</Intro>

| Steps                     | Actions                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Configure Terraform state | `atmos workflow init/tfstate -f baseline` |

## Setting up the Terraform State Backend

This is where we configure and run Atmos. Atmos is a workflow automation tool that we will use to call Terraform which
will provision all the accounts and resources you need to create and manage infrastructure. The Atmos configuration can
be found in the `atmos.yaml`.

If you're unfamiliar with atmos, you can read more about it [here](https://atmos.tools).

If you look at `components/terraform/`, you'll see a bunch of directories. These contain Terraform "root modules" that are provisioned with Atmos. At first they'll only have their vendor files, such as `components/terraform/tfstate-backend/component.yaml`.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Vendor the Terraform State Backend component

    Vendor the Terraform State Backend component by running the following command. The steps here require the `tfstate-backend` and `account-map` components.

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="vendor" fileName="baseline" />

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Initialize the Terraform State Backend

    Initialize the Terraform State Backend by running the following command:

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="init/tfstate" fileName="baseline" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Migrate all workspaces to S3

    When prompted, type `yes` to migrate all workspaces to S3.

    ```shell
    Initializing the backend...
    Do you want to migrate all workspaces to "s3"?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

:::info Granting SuperAdmin Access to Terraform State

The IAM User for SuperAdmin will be granted access to Terraform State by principal ARN. This ARN is passed to the
`tfstate-backend` stack catalog under `allowed_principal_arns`. Verify that this ARN is correct now. You may need to
update the root account ID.
