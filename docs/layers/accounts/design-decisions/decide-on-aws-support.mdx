<Intro>
When setting up AWS Support, you need to decide which accounts require paid support plans. If you don’t have an AWS Enterprise Agreement, it’s recommended to enable Business-level support in the root account to expedite requests and manage organizational limits effectively.
</Intro>

AWS Support is always enabled on a per-account basis. With an AWS Enterprise Agreement, AWS support is already included
from a billing perspective for all accounts, but it still needs to be enabled on a per-account basis.

:::caution

Cross-account support is not provided by AWS. AWS Support will not address support questions that affect one account,
from another account’s support subscription.

See
[https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#Cross-account_support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#Cross-account_support)

:::

If no Enterprise Agreement, then at a minimum we recommend enabling Business-level support in the root account, which
should cost roughly $100/mo (since nothing else runs in the root account). This enables us to expedite requests so that
organizational limits may be raised (e.g. member accounts). Without paid support, requests may take several days and are
more likely to be denied.
