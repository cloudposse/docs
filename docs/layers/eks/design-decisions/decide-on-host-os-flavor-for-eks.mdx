# Decide on Host OS Flavor for EKS

## Problem

We need to pick the AMI which will be used by the EKS cluster nodes. There are a few options and the right one depends
on your needs and organization’s requirements for compliance and packaging. It also relates to
[Decide on Technical Benchmark Framework](/layers/security-and-compliance/design-decisions/decide-on-technical-benchmark-framework)
and
[Decide on Strategy for Hardened Base AMIs](/layers/security-and-compliance/design-decisions/decide-on-strategy-for-hardened-base-amis).

## Solution

EKS managed & unmanaged node groups support the ability to have custom AMIs. By default, we use Amazon Linux.

Where this might be insufficient is if your organization requires a vetted OS or specific tools for audits.

Since this is a reversible decision, so we can start with Amazon Linux and change later if needed.

### Option 1: Bottlerocket

Amazon’s Bottlerocket OS is a container-native OS built to be immutable and only supports non-root containers. It
supports a Kubernetes Operator for automatically updating the cluster, in a way reminiscent of the `update_engine` of
the CoreOS (defunct).

### Option 2: Amazon Linux

Our standard recommendation is to use Amazon Linux’s EKS optimized image which is the most battle-tested in the AWS
landscape.

### Option 3: DIY

If we want to build custom AMIs, then we recommend using Packer with GitHub Action workflows to automatically build and
push AMIs.
