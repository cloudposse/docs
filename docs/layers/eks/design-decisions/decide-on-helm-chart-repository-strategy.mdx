## Problem

Helm charts were originally intended to be compiled into packages which are `.tar.gz` archives with a manifest and the
templatized kubernetes manifests. This chart repository will house proprietary charts your organization depends on and
therefore is on the critical path for both availability and supply-chain attacks. Any adversary who controls your chart
repository effectively controls what you can run on your cluster. The chart registry goes down, your company will be
unable to deploy applications via helm. The same goes for third-party charts, hosted on external registries.

## Solution

Fortunately, charts are very simple to produce and host. They are easily served from a VCS (e.g. git) or S3. There are a
few ways to host chart repositories, but our recommendation is just to use VCS. Using `terraform` or `helmfile`, we can
just point directly to GitHub and short-circuit the need for managing a chart repository altogether. Terraform natively
supports this pattern.

:::tip Our recommendation is to use GitHub directly and to avoid using chart repositories unless there are specific
requirements for it.

## Considerations

If we must, then here are the considerations:

1. **Use VCS** (e.g. GitHub) to pull charts directly and build on-demand.

2. **Use OCI** (docker registry) to push/pull charts (e.g. ECR). Support for terraform will probably drop soon.

3. **Use GitHub Actions** to build chart artifacts and push them to a static endpoint.

4. **Use Nexus** - Self-hosted artifactory alternative

5. **Use Artifactory** (SaaS preferred)

6. **Use S3** (public or private chart repositories)

7. **ChartMuseum** â†’ S3 [https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum)

Using Nexus or Artifactory make the most sense if we plan to use them elsewhere to cache artifacts.
