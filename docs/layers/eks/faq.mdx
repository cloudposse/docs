Frequently asked questions about EKS with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.

## How can I create secrets for an EKS cluster?

Consider deploying the [`external-secrets-operator` component](/components/library/aws/eks/external-secrets-operator).

This component creates an external SecretStore configured to synchronize secrets from AWS SSM Parameter store as
Kubernetes Secrets within the cluster. Per the operator pattern, the `external-secret-operator` pods will watch for any
`ExternalSecret` resources which reference the `SecretStore` to pull secrets from.

## How does the `alb-controller-ingress-group` determine the name of the ALB?

<Steps>
  1. First the component uses the [null-label](/modules/library/null/label) module to generate our intended name. We do this to meet the character length restrictions on ALB names. [ref](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/modules/eks/alb-controller-ingress-group/main.tf#L75-L83)
  1. Then we pass that output to the Kubernetes Ingress resource with an annotation intended to define the ALB's name. [ref](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/modules/eks/alb-controller-ingress-group/main.tf#L98)
  1. Now the Ingress is created and `alb-controller` creates an ALB using the annotations on that `Ingress`. This ALB name will have a dynamic character sequence at the end of it, so we cannot know what the name will be ahead of time.
  1. Finally, we grab the actual name that is given to the created ALB with the `data.aws_lb` resources. [ref](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/modules/eks/alb-controller-ingress-group/main.tf#L169)
  1. Then output that name for future reference. [ref](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/modules/eks/alb-controller-ingress-group/main.tf#L36)

## How can we create Self-Hosted Runners for GitHub with EKS?

Self-Hosted Runners are a great way to save cost and add customizations with GitHub Actions. Since we've already
implemented EKS for our platform, we can build off that foundation to create another cluster to manage Self-Hosted
runners in GitHub. We deploy that new EKS cluster to `core-auto` and install the
[Actions Runner Controller (ARC) chart](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller). This controller will
launch and scale runners for GitHub automatically.

For more on how to set up ARC, see the
[GitHub Action Runners setup docs for EKS](/reference-architecture/setup/github-actions-runners/).
