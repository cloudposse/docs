We first deploy the foundation for the cluster. The `eks/cluster` component deploys the initial EKS resources to AWS,
including Auth Config mapping. We do not deploy any nodes with the cluster initially. Then once EKS is available, we
connect to the cluster and start deploying resources. First is Karpenter. We deploy the Karpenter chart on a Fargate
node and the IAM service role to allow Karpenter to purchase Spot Instances. Karpenter is the only resources that will
be deployed to Fargate. Then we deploy Karpenter Provisioners using the CRD created by the initial Karpenter component.
These provisioners will automatically launch and scale the cluster to meet our demands. Next we deploy `idp-roles` to
manage custom roles for the cluster, and deploy `metrics-server` to provide access to resource metrics.

Then we connect the cluster to our network. First we must deploy the `cert-manager` component to provision X.509
certificates on the cluster. Then we deploy the `alb-controller` component to provision and associate ALBs or NLBs based
on `Ingress` annotations that route traffic to the cluster. Then we deploy the `alb-controller-ingress-group` to
actually create that ALB. Next, we deploy `external-dns` which will look for annotations to make services discoverable,
and then create records in our Route 53 Hosted Zones mapping to the cluster. Finally we deploy `echo-server` to validate
the complete setup.

:::info

Connecting to an EKS cluster requires a VPN connection! See [ec2-client-vpn](/components/library/aws/ec2-client-vpn/)
for details.

:::

Depending on your application requirements we can also deploy a number of operators. The most common is the
`efs-controller`, which we use to provide encrypted block storage that is not zone-locked. Other operators are
optionally but often include the `external-secrets-operator` to automatically sync secrets from AWS SSM Parameter Store.

Monitoring and release engineering are handled separately from the components mentioned here, and we will expand of
those implementations in follow up topics. For details, see the
[Monitoring](/reference-architecture/category/quick-start/) and
[Release Engineering](/reference-architecture/category/quick-start/) quick start documents.

#### Foundation

- [`eks/cluster`](/components/library/aws/eks/cluster/): This component is responsible for provisioning an end-to-end
  EKS Cluster, including IAM role to Kubernetes Auth Config mapping.
- [`eks/karpenter`](/components/library/aws/eks/karpenter/): Installs the Karpenter chart on the EKS cluster and
  prepares the environment for provisioners.
  - [`eks/karpenter-provisioner`](/components/library/aws/eks/karpenter-provisioner/): Deploys Karpenter Provisioners
    using CRDs made available by `eks/karpenter`
  - [`iam-service-linked-roles`](/components/library/aws/iam-service-linked-roles/): Provisions
    [IAM Service-Linked](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) roles. These
    are required for Karpenter to purchase Spot instances.
- [`idp-roles`](/components/library/aws/eks/idp-roles): These identity provider roles specify several pre-determined
  permission levels for cluster users and come with bindings that make them easy to assign to Users and Groups. Use this
  component to define custom permission within EKS.
- [`metrics-server`](/components/library/aws/eks/metrics-server): A Kubernetes addon that provides resource usage
  metrics used in particular by other addons such Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. For more, see
  [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server).
- [`reloader`](/components/library/aws/eks/reloader): Installs the
  [Stakater Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) for EKS clusters. `reloader` can watch `ConfigMaps` and
  `Secrets` for changes and use these to trigger rolling upgrades on pods and their associated `DeploymentConfigs`,
  `Deployments`, `Daemonsets` `Statefulsets` and `Rollouts`.

#### Network

- [`cert-manager`](/components/library/aws/eks/cert-manager): A Kubernetes addon that provisions X.509 certificates.
- [`alb-controller`](/components/library/aws/eks/alb-controller): A Kubernetes addon that, in the context of AWS,
  provisions and manages ALBs and NLBs based on `Service` and `Ingress` annotations. This module is also provision a
  default `IngressClass`.
  - [`alb-controller-ingress-group`](/components/library/aws/eks/alb-controller-ingress-group): A Kubernetes Service
    that creates an ALB for a specific `IngressGroup`. An `IngressGroup` is a feature of the `alb-controller` which
    allows multiple Kubernetes Ingresses to share the same Application Load Balancer.
- [`external-dns`](/components/library/aws/eks/external-dns): A Kubernetes addon that configures public DNS servers with
  information about exposed Kubernetes services to make them discoverable. This component is responsible for adding DNS
  records to your Route 53 Hosted Zones.
- [`echo-server`](/components/library/aws/eks/echo-server): The echo server is a server that sends it back to the client
  a JSON representation of all the data the server received. We use this component is validate a cluster deployment.

#### Storage

- [`efs`](/components/library/aws/efs/): Deploys an [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) Network File System with KMS
  encryption-at-rest. EFS is an excellent choice as the default block storage for EKS clusters so that volumes are not
  zone-locked.
  - [`eks/efs-controller`](/components/library/aws/eks/efs-controller/): Deploys
    [the Amazon Elastic File System Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver)
    to EKS. The Amazon EFS CSI Driver implements the CSI specification for container orchestrators to manage the
    lifecycle of Amazon EFS file systems.

#### Additional Operators

- [`external-secrets-operator`](/components/library/aws/eks/external-secrets-operator/): This component (ESO) is used to
  create an external `SecretStore` configured to synchronize secrets from AWS SSM Parameter store as Kubernetes Secrets
  within the cluster.
