# Decide on Organization Supernet CIDR Ranges

## Problem

- We need to record all existing and provisioned CIDR ranges as a system of record, as well as any additional context as
  necessary (E.g. what the CIDRs are used for).

- We need to decide on the all-encompassing CIDR for this organization for contiguous networks. Itâ€™s not a requirement,
  but a strong recommendation.

- All VPCs subnets should be carved out of this supernet.

## Solution

- Document the CIDR ranges provisioned for all the accounts in ADR so we know what is in use today

- Add any other known CIDR ranges (e.g. from other accounts not under this AWS organization)

- Take into account any multi-cloud, multi-region strategies.
