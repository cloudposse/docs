# Deploying the Network

The first step in deploying the network is to deploy the VPCs in each region. This will create the necessary foundation
for the platform to run and includes the VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, and VPC endpoints.

## Deployment

First, vendor the networking components by running the following:

```bash
atmos workflow vendor -f network
```

Once this is done, initialize all the VPCs in every configured region by running the following command:

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/vpc -f network
```

Once all VPCs are deployed, decomission the default VPC in each region by running the following command from within the
Geodesic shell:

```bash
wipe-default-vpcs
```
