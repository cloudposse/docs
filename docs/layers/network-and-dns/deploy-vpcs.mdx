# Deploying the Network

## Deployment

First, vendor the networking components by running the following:

```bash
atmos workflow vendor -f network
```

Once this is done, initialize all the VPCs in every configured region by running the following command:

```bash
atmos workflow deploy/vpc -f network
```
