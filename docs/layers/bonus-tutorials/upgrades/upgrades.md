# Upgrades

Upgrades to tools like Amazon EKS, Atmos, and Terraform involve the process of updating the software to newer versions, incorporating enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches. The upgrade guides here provide comprehensive guidance on each upgrade process. The documentation then details step-by-step instructions for upgrading different components. Additionally, the documentation may offer troubleshooting tips, best practices, and guidance on testing the upgrade in non-production environments to minimize any impact on live systems. Regularly updated release notes are often included, providing users with insights into new features, bug fixes, and security enhancements introduced in the latest version.
