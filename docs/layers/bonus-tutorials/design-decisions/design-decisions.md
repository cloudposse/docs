# Design Decisions
Design Decisions are architectural considerations for how to approach or implement some sort of functionality. Each Design Decision references the corresponding REFARCH ticket in jira. The decision outcomes should be documented as Architectural Design Records (ADRs).

See [https://cloudposse.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=1173454868](https://cloudposse.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=1173454868) for adding design decisions to this reference architecture as well as [How to write ADRs](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/tutorials/how-to-write-adrs) .

This is our entire reference catalog of Design Decisions and not all may be relevant to the scope of a particular engagement.
