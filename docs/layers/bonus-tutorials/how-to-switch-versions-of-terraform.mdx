## Problem

You need to use (or want to upgrade to) the latest version of terraform for a component you’re working on, but do not want to affect other components.

## Solution

#### Install Desired Version of Terraform

First, make sure you’ve installed the latest version of `terraform` in [Geodesic](/fundamentals/geodesic) by following our guide [How to Upgrade or Install Versions of Terraform](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/upgrades/how-to-upgrade-or-install-versions-of-terraform).

#### Switch Terraform Versions (Local Geodesic Shell)

:::tip
You can pin the version of `terraform` using `update-alternatives` as well as in the component configuration.

:::
To see Versions supported Check either the _Dockerfile_, or run `ls /usr/share/terraform/` on your geodesic shell

```
update-alternatives --set terraform /usr/share/terraform/${Major.Minor}/bin/terraform
```

### Terraform Releases

#### Switch Terraform Versions for a Component on a stack

Update the terrafrom component’s settings in `<ProjectDir>/stacks/globals.yaml` to set the default atmos terraform version and the spacelift version. an example configuration would look like

```
components:
  terraform:
    <component>:
      settings:
        spacelift:
          terraform_version: "0.14"         # Version of terraform used by Spacelift
      command: "/usr/bin/terraform-0.14"    # Version of terraform used by Atmos on the command line
```

This would then set the spacelift version and local atmos version to use a specific terraform Major.Minor version for that component.

**Note** the `major.minor.patch` versions are defined (and installed) in the Dockerfile of the Project.

:::caution
Spacelift installs the version of terraform specified in `terraform_version` and does not use the package distributed in the container.  The `terraform_version` must be defined in the `spacelift/default.auto.tfvars` file.

:::

#### Spacelift Version Mapping

By convention, we have components pin only to _major_ versions of terraform and not patch releases. The precise version of terraform used is configured in the `spacelift/default.auto.tfvars` file. Note, that the `spacelift` component is not yet configurable via stack configurations and all tuning is done via the `default.auto.tfvars` file.

:::caution
Spacelift does not always support the bleeding edge patch releases of terraform. Reach out to spacelift if the version you need is not available and they’ll let you know the ETA.

:::

```
terraform_version = "0.14.11"  # Default version of terraform to use
terraform_version_map = {      # Map major versions to precise versions of terraform
  "0.14" = "0.14.11"
  "0.15" = "0.15.5"
  "1.0"  = "1.0.9"
}
```
