<Intro>
Sometimes there will be a need to host private Terraform modules that may exist outside the infrastructure monorepo. When this is the case, Spacelift needs access to these module registries or repositories. There are a few ways to go about it, with various tradeoffs to ensure secure and efficient module management while minimizing complexity and risk.

**Date**: **19 Oct 2021**

## Status

**DRAFT**

## Problem

App (or other) repositories outside the infrastructure monorepo may require access to other GitHub repositories, such as an in-house terraform module.

By default, Spacelift only has access to a single repository when cloning and only clones the app repository.

## Considered Options

#### Option 1: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) **RECOMMENDED**

Cloud Posse usually uses this approach on private runners.

- `.netrc` would require a read-only PAT (spenmo doesn’t like PATs) on a shared bot user

- PAT could have access to multiple repositories

- Private terraform modules should be referenced like `git::https://github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-example`

#### Option 2: Use the Spacelift private module registry

- This uses the Spacelift Github App permissions

- The infrastructure module would be turned into a terraform module in the private registry.

- The `source` of the terraform module would point to spacelift i.e. `spacelift.io/<organization>/<module_name>/<provider>` e.g. `spacelift.io/client-org/infrastructure/aws`

- Local spacelift API creds would be needed to iterate to retrieve the module source

- or we could set up the terraform for local sources and use something like an on-the-fly terraform change in a `before_init` hook

#### Option 3: Use a Github App

- Private terraform modules should be referenced like `git::https://github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-example`

#### Option 4: Use a GitHub “deploy” key **NOT RECOMMENDED**

Cloud Posse recommends avoiding this approach.

- Private terraform modules should be referenced like `git::https://github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-example`

- Configure an SSH “deploy” key on a shared bot user

- Deploy key will only have access to a single repository

- [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deploy-keys](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deploy-keys)

- Unfortunately, deploy keys cannot be shared across repositories, meaning many keys will need to be managed if there are a lot of private repositories.

### Options on how to use the key

#### Option 1: Private worker pools bake a static token in userdata

Cloud Posse usually uses this approach on private runners.

- Retrieve the token from SSM

- Save it in the userdata of the spacelift worker pool

- Mount the token as an environment variable for all runs

#### Option 2: Use only a `before_init` hook

- The app id and app pem are used to create a JWT which is used to create a temporary 1hr access token

- The spacelift worker pool uses a `before_init` hook

- to retrieve the token from SSM to create the `.netrc` file on-the-fly

- to run `git config url.insteadof` to replace the source with the user and token

#### Option 3: Use a mounted file per stack

Cloud Posse recommends avoiding this approach.

- This would require retrieving the secret during the admin stack `spacelift` component run and adding the secret to each stack as a file

- Then once the secret is added, a `before_init` hook would be required
