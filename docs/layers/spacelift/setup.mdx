## Requirements

### Sign Up for Spacelift

First, sign up for Spacelift. Follow these steps, and see [the detailed documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/integrations/spacelift/) for additional information.

<Steps>
1. Sign up [Get started with Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/free-trial)
1. Install Spacelift GitHub app into the customer GitHub organization
   1. Once the app is installed into the customer GitHub organization, the GitHub organization admin will receive an
      email from Spacelift
1. Click on the link in the email from Spacelift
   1. After the Spacelift app has been installed and enabled, only the integration creator (the admin of the customer
      GitHub org) gets administrative permissions by default, so all other users and administrators must be granted
      their access using a login policy.
1. Add the following login policy.
   1. Click `Policies` at the top
   1. Click `Add Policies`
   1. Set a name like `Login Policy`
   1. Change the policy type to `Login policy`
   1. Copy and paste the policy below
   1. Change the `user_collaborators` to the customer github org
   1. Add any additional `admin_collaborators`, if required
   1. Add the Cloud Posse team `CLOUDPOSSE-CASE-SENSITIVE-TEAM-NAME` and non cloudposse `YOUR-CASE-SENSITIVE-TEAM-NAME`
      team names.
   1. Finally, click `Create Policy`

      ```rego
      package spacelift
      # See https://docs.spacelift.io/concepts/policy/login-policy for implementation details.
      # Note: Login policies don't affect GitHub organization or SSO admins.
      # Note 2: Enabling SSO requires that all users have an IdP (G Suite) account, so we'll just use
      #          GitHub authentication in the meantime while working with external collaborators.
      # Map session input data to human friendly variables to use in policy evaluation
      username	:= input.session.login
      member_of   := input.session.teams

      github_org   := input.session.member

      # Define GitHub usernames of non-github_org org external collaborators with admin vs. user access
      admin_collaborators := {} # case sensitive GitHub handles of additional admin collaborators

      user_collaborators  := { "acme" } # case sensitive name of the github org

      # Grant admin access to github_org org members in the non cloud posse case-sensitive team
      # Do not use the slug here, use the name shown in github.com/org/teams
      admin {
        github_org
        member_of[_] == "YOUR-CASE-SENSITIVE-TEAM-NAME"
      }

      # Grant admin access to github_org org members in the Cloud Posse group
      # Do not use the slug here, use the name shown in github.com/org/teams
      admin {
        github_org
        member_of[_] == "CLOUDPOSSE-CASE-SENSITIVE-TEAM-NAME"
      }

      # Grant admin access to non-github_org org accounts in the admin_collaborators set
      admin {
        # not github_org
        admin_collaborators[username]
      }

      # Grant user access to accounts in the user_collaborators set
      allow {
        # not github_org
        user_collaborators[username]
      }

      # Deny access to any non-github_org org accounts who aren't defined in external collaborators sets
      deny {
        not github_org
        not user_collaborators[username]
        not admin_collaborators[username]
      }
      ```

 5. Verify Cloud Posse users have administrative access

1. Create an administrative API key
   1. Click the three horizontal bars on the top right hand corner
   1. Click `Settings`
   1. Click `API KEYS`
   1. Click Add new API Key
   1. Give it a name like `Spacelift worker pool API admin key`
   1. Enable `Admin`
   1. Click `Add Key`
   1. A file will download. Save the contents to our shared 1Password vault. This will give us the `key_secret` and the
      `token`.
   1. Also share the 26 character string next to the name of the key which gives us the `key_id`.

</Steps>

### Upload the API Key

In order for the `spacelift/worker-pool` component to connect to the given Spacelift account, we need to add the
previously created Spacelift API Key to SSM.

Create the following two parameters in AWS SSM Parameter Store in the same AWS account and region where the Spacelift
Worker Pool will be deployed. In this case, that is `core-use1-auto`.

| Key     | SSM Path                | Type           |
| :------ | :---------------------- | :------------- |
| API ID  | `/spacelift/key_id`     | `SecureString` |
| API Key | `/spacelift/key_secret` | `SecureString` |

_HINT: The API key ID is displayed as an upper-case, 26-character alphanumeric value next to the key name in the API key
list._

This step can be executed with an Atmos Workflow! Run the follow and enter the API Key ID and Secret when prompted:

```shell
atmos workflow init -f spacelift
```

## How To

<Steps>
### Vendor

Spacelift adds three components, `spacelift/worker-pool`, `spacelift/admin-stack`, and `spacelift/spaces`. Vendor these
components either with the included Atmos Workflows or with Atmos Vendor.

```shell
atmos workflow vendor -f spacelift
```

or

```shell
atmos vendor pull --component spacelift
```

### Deploy

Spacelift can be deployed with Atmos Workflows or by manual steps. If using Workflows, you must first upload the
Spacelift API Key to AWS SSM, described above. Once the API Key is created in SSM, connected to Geodesic and run:

```shell
atmos workflow deploy/worker-pool -f spacelift
set-spacelift-environment
atmos workflow deploy/admin-stack -f spacelift
```

All other configuration should be preset, but if you encounter errors, verify the following manual steps have been set
up correctly.

#### Setting up the Spacelift Worker Pool

The `spacelift/worker-pool` component is responsible for deploying an Auto Scaling Group in AWS that will launch
instances for Spacelift to attach a number of runners onto. For additional details, see
[worker-pool](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/spacelift/worker-pool/).

#### Deploy `spacelift/worker-pool`

Deploy the component into the `auto` account in the primary region:

```shell
atmos terraform apply spacelift/worker-pool -s core-use1-auto
```

or

```shell
atmos workflow deploy/worker-pool -f spacelift
```

After Terraform finishes applying, take note of the Terraform outputs `worker_pool_id`, `worker_pool_name`, and
`trusted_role_arns`.

##### IAM configuration

**Note:** This step should already be done by the identity automated setup. If you are having trouble with IAM
permission and access in Spacelift, verify the follow role has been set correctly.

You must give the created instance role permission to assume the Spacelift worker role. This is done by adding
`iam_role_arn` from the output to the `trusted_role_arns` list for the `spacelift` role in `aws-teams` in
`stacks/catalog/aws-teams.yaml`.

#### Deploying Spacelift Stacks

The `spacelift` component is responsible for provisioning the Admin Spacelift stacks. These Admin stacks are then
responsible for deploying _all_ other Spacelift stacks. This is where each component stack is created.

##### Validate the `spacelift` catalog

These configuration settings should be set already, but in case of errors, these are the dynamic variables set for a
particular customer.

1. `repository` = Name of `infrastructure` repository
1. `branch` = Name of main/master branch
1. Set `components.terraform.spacelift.settings.spacelift.worker_pool_name` to the name of the worker pool you want to
   use for the `spacelift` component. This is typically set with default Spacelift settings at
   `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml`

##### Set the Spacelift Environment

To assume the Spacelift provider, we need to add the Spacelift API Key to our environment. Run the included script from
Geodesic to assume the proper IAM role and pull the API Key from SSM:

```
set-spacelift-environment
```

Or manually set these ENV vars:

```bash
export SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ENDPOINT=https://acme.app.spacelift.io
export SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID=...
export SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET=...
```

##### Deploy the admin stacks

```shell
atmos terraform apply admin-stack --stack root-gbl-spacelift
atmos terraform apply admin-stack --stack core-gbl-spacelift
atmos terraform apply admin-stack --stack plat-gbl-spacelift
```

or

```shell
atmos workflow deploy/root-admin-stack -f spacelift
atmos workflow deploy/admin-stack -f spacelift
```

Note that this is the only manually operation you need to perform in `geodesic` using `atmos` to create the initial
admin stack. All other infrastructure stacks will be created in Spacelift by this admin stack.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a new branch & make changes
2. Create a new pull request (targeting the `main` branch)
3. View the modified resources directly in the pull request
4. View the successful Spacelift checks in the pull request
5. Merge the pull request and check the Spacelift job

## How to use `spacectl`?

See docs https://github.com/spacelift-io/spacectl

### Install

```shell
⨠ apt install -y spacectl -qq
```

Setup a profile

```shell
⨠ spacectl profile login gbl-identity
Enter Spacelift endpoint (eg. https://unicorn.app.spacelift.io/): https://<GITHUB_ORG>.app.spacelift.io
Select credentials type: 1 for API key, 2 for GitHub access token: 1
Enter API key ID: 01FKN...
Enter API key secret:
```

### Listing stacks

```bash
spacectl stack list
```

Grab all the stack ids (use the JSON output to avoid bad chars)

```bash
spacectl stack list --output json | jq -r '.[].id' > stacks.txt
```

If the latest commit for each stack is desired, run something like this.

NOTE: remove the `echo` to remove the dry-run functionality

```bash
cat stacks.txt | while read stack; do echo $stack && echo spacectl stack set-current-commit --sha 25dd359749cfe30c76cce19f58e0a33555256afd --id $stack; done
```
