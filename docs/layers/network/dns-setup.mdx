## Requirements

Before deploying DNS, first purchase your chosen vanity and service domains in the `core-dns` account or in your chosen registrar. Refer back to the [Decide on Vanity (Branded) Domain](/layers/network/design-decisions/decide-on-vanity-branded-domain/) and [Decide on Service Discovery Domain](/layers/network/design-decisions/decide-on-service-discovery-domain/) design decisions for more information.

When registering a new domain, we have the option of using Route53â€™s built-in registrar or using an existing registrar. Many enterprise-scale organizations use MarkMonitor to manage their domain portfolio. Our convention is to use the `core-dns` account as the registrar. This allows us to use AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access to the registered domains and to centralized DNS management.

<Note>the AWS Route53 Registrar cannot be automated with Terraform, so ClickOps is still required for domain registration.</Note>

We recommend checking with your legal department on where they want to consolidate domain ownership. It has larger
ramifications as to IP/trademark defense.

    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy DNS Components

    The DNS stacks are broken up into primary and delegated deployments. Primary DNS zones only start with an `NS` record
    among other defaults and expect the the owner of their associated domain to add these `NS` records to whatever console manages the respective domain.
    Consult the [dns-primary component documentation](/components/library/aws/dns-primary/) for more information.

    The delegated DNS zones insert their `NS` records into the primary DNS zone; thus they are mostly automated.
    Consult the [dns-delegated component documentation](/components/library/aws/dns-delegated/) for more information.

    To start the dns setup, run the following. This will go through creating primaries, and then
    follow up with establishing the delegates.

  <Step>

    ## <StepNumber/> Configure Registrar `NS` Records for Domain (Click Ops)

    In order to connect the newly provisioned Hosted Zone to the purchased domains, add the `NS` records to the chosen
    Domain Registrar. Retrieve these with the output of `dns-primary`. These will need to be manually added to the
    registered domain.

    <Steps>
    - #### Delegate Shared Service Domain, `acme-svc.com`

      ```shell
      atmos terraform output dns-primary -s core-gbl-dns
      ```

    - #### Delegate Platform Sandbox Vanity Domain, `acme-sandbox.com`

      ```shell
      atmos terraform output dns-primary -s plat-gbl-sandbox
      ```

    - #### Delegate Platform Dev Vanity Domain, `acme-dev.com`

      ```shell
      atmos terraform output dns-primary -s plat-gbl-dev
      ```

    - #### Delegate Platform Staging Vanity Domain, `acme-stage.com`

      ```shell
      atmos terraform output dns-primary -s plat-gbl-staging
      ```

    - #### Delegate Platform Prod Vanity Domain, `acme-prod.com`

      ```shell
      atmos terraform output dns-primary -s plat-gbl-prod
      ```
    </Steps>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### ACM

Each domain managed by the `dns-primary` component will create its own ACM certificate. However, we need additional ACM certificates to validate delegated domains.
We use a separate instance of the `acm` component to provision each service domain certificate.

We can deploy all required ACM certificates with the following command:

    <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/acm" fileName="quickstart/foundation/network" />
