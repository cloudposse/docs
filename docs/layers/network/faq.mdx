Frequently asked questions about network and DNS with Cloud Posse's reference architecture.

## What is the difference between a Vanity and a Service Domain?

Service domains are fully automated constructions of host names without concern for marketing or branding. Although they
are not secret, the public will never see them. We use these domains for logic driven service discovery of resources
across the organization.

On the other hand vanity domains are entirely up to the requirements of the business. Marketing may require hundreds or
thousand of domains to be associated with an application, and these domains may not follow any naming pattern or
hierarchy. These are the domains used by the customer.

## Can we add additional VPCs?

Yes you can create additional VPCs, although we recommend against it. By design, we implement account-level separation
rather than VPC network data separation. So before creating a new VPC, ask yourself if the ultimate objective would be
better accomplished by a new account.

If you do want to continue with creating a new VPC, simply define a new instance of the `vpc` component in a given
stack. Give that component a new name, such as `vpc/data-1`, and then inherit the default vpc settings.

## How can we add an additional region?

In order to add a new network region:

<Steps>
  1. Create a new mixin for the region: `stacks/mixins/{{ region }}/`
  1. Define a new stack configuration for the region. The regions of any given account are defined by resources in the directories for the given region, `stacks/orgs/{{ namespace }}/{{ tenant }}/{{ stage }}/{{ region }}/`
  1. Add the required resources to the stack file, `stacks/orgs/{{ namespace }}/{{ tenant }}/{{ stage }}/{{ region }}/network.yaml`. For example for networking, define a new VPC, connect Transit Gateway, and define Client VPN routes to the new regions.
</Steps>

## How can we connect a legacy AWS account to our network?

Connect a legacy AWS account with VPC Peering. For more, see the
[`vpc-peering` component](/components/library/aws/vpc-peering/)

## Why not use `dns-delegated` for all vanity domains?

The purpose of the `dns` account is to host root domains shared by several accounts (with each account being delegated
its own subdomain) and to be the owner of domain registrations purchased from Amazon.

The purpose of the `dns-primary` component is to provision AWS Route53 zones for the root domains. These zones, once
provisioned, must be manually configured into the Domain Name Registrar's records as name servers. A single component
can provision multiple domains and, optionally, associated ACM (SSL) certificates in a single account.

Cloud Posse's architecture allows/requires that root domains shared by several accounts be provisioned in the `dns`
account with `dns-primary` and delegated to other accounts with each account getting its own subdomain corresponding to
a Route 53 zone in the delegated account. Cloud Posse's architecture requires at least one such domain, called "the
service domain", be provisioned. The service domain is not customer facing and is provisioned to allow fully automated
construction of host names without any concerns about how they look. Although they are not secret, the public will never
see them.

Root domains used by a single account are provisioned with the `dns-primary` component directly in that account. Cloud
Posse calls these "vanity domains". These can be whatever the marketing or PR or other stakeholders want to be.

**There is no support for `dns-primary` to provision root domains outside of the dns account that are to be shared by
multiple accounts.**

After a domain is provisioned in the `dns` account, the `dns-delegated` component can provision one or more subdomains
for each account, and, optionally, associated ACM certificates. For the service domain, Cloud Posse recommends using the
account name as the delegated subdomain (either directly, e.g. "plat-dev", or as multiple subdomains, e.g. "dev.plat")
because that allows `dns-delegated` to automatically provision any required host name in that zone.

So, the `dns` account gets a single `dns-primary` component deployed. Every other account that needs DNS entries gets a
single `dns-delegated` component, chaining off the domains in the `dns` account. Optionally, accounts can have a single
`dns-primary` component of their own, to have apex domains (which Cloud Posse calls "vanity domains"). Typically, these
domains are configured with CNAME (or apex alias) records to point to service domain entries.

The architecture does not support other configurations, or non-standard component names.

## Why should the `dns-delegated` component be deployed globally rather than regionally?

The `dns-delegated` component is designed to manage resources across all regions within an AWS account, such as with Route 53 DNS records. Deploying it at the regional level can lead to conflicts because it implies multiple deployments per account, which would cause Terraform to fight for control over the same resources.

Although the `gbl` (“global”) region is not a real AWS region, it is used as a placeholder to signify that resources are meant to be managed globally, not regionally. Deploying `dns-delegated` globally ensures there is a single source of truth for these DNS records within the account.

Deploying this component regionally can cause issues, especially if multiple regional stacks try to manage the same DNS records. This creates an anti-pattern where resources meant to be global are unintentionally duplicated, leading to configuration drift and unexpected behavior.

Please see the [global (default) region](/learn/conventions/#global-default-region) definition for more on `gbl` as a convention.

## How is the EKS network configured?

EKS network is designed with this network and DNS architecture in mind, but is another complex topic. For more, see the
following:

- [EKS Fundamentals](/layers/eks)
- [EKS - How To Setup Vanity Domains on an ALB](/layers/eks/tutorials/how-to-setup-vanity-domains-on-alb-eks)

:::info

Private subnets are kept large to account for EKS configurations that can consume a significant amount of IP addresses.

## How is the ECS network configured?

ECS connectivity is also designed with this network and DNS architecture in mind. For more, see the following:
