## Context and Problem Statement

VPC peering is used when we need network connectivity between VPCs - possibly residing in different accounts underneath
different organizations.

## Use cases

- Peering with legacy/heritage accounts to facilitate migrations with minimal downtime.

- Enablement of CI/CD to connect to clusters and databases within VPCs

- Service migration

- Connecting VPCs in multiple regions

## Considered Options

### VPC Peering

:::tip Our recommendation is to use VPC peering mostly for connecting third-party networks or for cost optimization over
transit gateways (when necessary).

:::

This is where we would provision a vpc-peering component and require the legacy vpc id, account id, and an IAM role that
can be assumed by the identity account.

Direct VPC peering may reduce costs where there’s significant traffic going between two VPCs.

### Transit Gateway

:::tip Our recommendation is to _always_ deploy a transit gateway so we can use it with Terraform automation to manage
clusters and databases. <i>This is regardless of whether or not we deploy VPC peering.</i>

:::

An alternative approach to VPC peering between accounts in AWS is also to leverage the transit gateway, which we usually
deploy in most engagements to facilitate CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Spacelift automation.

This would require a transit gateway already set up and configured in the legacy account so we can peer the v2
transit-gateway with the v1 infrastructure.

Be advised, that _excessive_ traffic over a transit-gateway will be costly. This is why there is a use-case to leverage
both VPC peering and transit gateways. If the costs are significant between any two VPCs, direct VPC peering is a more
cost-effective way to do it because the traffic doesn't egress to the transit gateway and then ingress back into the
other account, effectively cutting transit costs in half.

### NAT Gateways

If there are overlapping CIDR ranges in the VPCs, we’ll also need to consider deploying private NAT gateways to
translate network addresses.
