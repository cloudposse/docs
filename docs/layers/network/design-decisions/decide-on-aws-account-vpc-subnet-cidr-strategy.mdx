## Problem

We need to devise a subnet allocation scheme tolerant of multiple accounts operating in multiple regions that do not
conflict with any other ranges which may need to be peered in the future.

## General Considerations

- Having unique, non-overlapping VPC CIDRs makes connecting clusters to each other much easier

- Each VPC must be subdivided into several non-overlapping subnet ranges to provide public and private address spaces
  across multiple availability zones

- **ALBs need a minimum of 2 subnets allocated**

### EKS Considerations

- Using Amazon’s CNI, each Kubernetes pod gets its own IP in the subnet, and additional IPs are reserved so they are
  immediately available for new pods when they are launched

- You will need a lot more IPs than you anticipate due to performance optimizations in how CNIs are managed by EKS

  [https://medium.com/codex/kubernetes-cluster-running-out-of-ip-addresses-on-aws-eks-c7b8e5dd8606](https://medium.com/codex/kubernetes-cluster-running-out-of-ip-addresses-on-aws-eks-c7b8e5dd8606)

- AWS supports the `eksctl` tool (we do not). Their default recommendation is:

  > The default VPC CIDR used by `eksctl` is `192.168.0.0/16`. It is divided into 8 (`/19`) subnets (3 private, 3 public
  > & 2 reserved).

- EKS clusters limit the number of pods based on the number of
  [ENIs available per instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI).

- [Kubernetes has limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/), but those are pretty high.
  **The reality is most clusters operate at a much smaller scale.** At v1.18, Kubernetes supports clusters with up to
  5000 nodes. More specifically, we support configurations that meet _all_ of the following criteria:

- No more than 5000 nodes

- No more than 150000 total pods

- No more than 300000 total containers

- No more than 100 pods per node

- EKS [will use either](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/216#issue-423314258) 10.100.0.0/16 or
  172.20.0.0/16 for cluster Services, so avoiding those ranges will avoid some problems with inter-cluster routing

:::caution Use CIDR ranges smaller than a `/19` at your own risk.

Cloud Posse does not take responsibility for any EKS cluster issues related to underprovisioning CIDR ranges.

:::

## Our standard recommendation

- Each account gets it's own `/16` (65,534 usable IPs) (or `/15` = 2 x `/16` for more than 4 total regions),
  consecutively numbered, starting with 10.101.0.0

- Each region in an account gets 1 x `/18` (16,382 usable IPs), usually allocated as 1 or 2 countries/legislative areas
  per account, each with 2 regions for DR/failover

- Each region allocates 6 x `/21` (2,046 usable IPs) subnets (3 AZ \* (public + private)) for EKS.

- Any additional “single purpose” subnets in a region should be `/24` (254 usable IPs)
