## Context and Problem Statement

The [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) connects VPCs located in any account or organization
(and on-premises networks) through a centrally managed network hub. This simplifies the work of connecting networks and
puts an end to complex VPC peering connections. Think of it like a cloud router, where each new connection is only made
once.

As you expand globally, inter-region peering connections, the AWS Transit Gateway helps establish a global network. All
data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.

With this in mind, the transit gateway needs to be configured to support the specific For example:

- In which accounts will certain services live (e.g. Automation/Spacelift Runners, custom apps, etc)?

- Where will the VPN solution be deployed, if there is one?

- In which accounts will EKS clusters be deployed to?

- Do certain stages need to communicate with one another (e.g. staging → prod and prod → staging)?

## Considered Options

### Option 1 (Recommended)

:::tip Cloud Posse recommends Option 1 because it enables the use of automation to perform changes as well as any other
business requirement

:::

- Connect all accounts with the `auto` account to enable automation (Spacelift, GitHub Action Runners, etc)

- Connect all accounts with the `network` account to use it as the entry-point for VPN connections

- Any other requirements that are business driven (e.g. dev → staging, staging → prod, dev → dev, etc)

#### Consequences

- Can use automation (Spacelift) to handle changes to infrastructure

- Can create private EKS clusters, accessible via automation and human (via VPN)
