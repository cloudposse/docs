## Context and Problem Statement

You need to remotely access resource that reside in a private VPC. Different teams or individuals need access to
different resources.

## Solution

Use AWS Client VPN for remote user access.

## Considered Options

Each option below can be integrated with AWS SSO.

### Option 1: Deploy 1 Client VPN in the Network Account

:::tip Our Recommendation is to use Option 1 for customers who do not need fine-grained network access controls. Anyone
on the VPN should have access to all network services via the Transit Gateway.

:::

Ideal for companies where one team will require access to all accounts and there are no plans to introduce access for
other teams.

#### Pros

- Anyone on the VPN has access to all network services via the Transit Gateway

- Least expensive to operate

- No need to switch networks once connected to VPN

#### Cons

- Total access to every account

### Option 2: Deploy Multiple Client VPNs Depending on Network Segments in the Network Account

Ideal for companies where certain teams require segmented access to multiple accounts. We define these accounts as a
segment.

#### Pros

- More access control options

#### Cons

- More expensive to operate

- Deciding on how to segment the network can be a complex decision

- Requires switching VPNs when accessing another account. This is more disruptive to developer workflows

### Option 3: Deploy Client VPN(s) Directly in the Accounts Needed

This is a requirement when you know you need very granular access controls with restricting access to certain accounts.

#### Pros

- Highest level of access control to each account.

#### Cons

- Most expensive to operate and grows as more accounts are added

- Requires switching VPNs when accessing another account. This is the most disruptive path to developer workflows.
