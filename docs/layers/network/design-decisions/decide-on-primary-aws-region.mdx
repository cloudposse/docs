While the company might operate in multiple regions, one region should be selected as the primary region. There are
certain resources that will not be geographically distributed and these should be provisioned in this default region.

When starting from scratch with a new AWS account, it's a good time to revisit decisions that might have been made
decades ago. There are many new AWS regions that might be better suited for the business.

### Customer Proximity

One good option is picking a default region that is closest to the where the majority of end-users reside.

### Business Headquarters

One good option is picking a default region that is closest to where the majority of business operations take place.
This is especially true if most of the services in the default region will be consumed by the business itself.

### Stability

When operating on AWS, selecting a region other than `us-east-1` is advisable as this is the default region (or used to
be) for most AWS users. It has historically had the most service interruptions presumably because it is one of the most
heavily-used regions and operates at a scale much larger than other AWS regions. Therefore we advise using `us-east-2`
over `us-east-1` and the latencies between these regions is very minimal.

### High Availability / Availability Zones

Not all AWS regions support the same number of availability zones.
[Many regions only offer (2) availability zones](https://howto.lintel.in/list-of-aws-regions-and-availability-zones/)
when a minimum of (3) is recommended when operating kubernetes to avoid "split-brain" problems.

### Cost

Not all regions cost the same to operate.

### Service Availability

Not all regions offer the full suite of AWS services or receive new services at the same rate as others. Some regions
receive platform infrastructure updates slower than others. AWS also offers
[Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#AWS_Local_Zones) (e.g.
`us-west-2-lax-1a`) which operate a subset of AWS services.

See [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for
a complete breakdown of service availability by region.

Several services used in the reference architecture are only available in a subset of AWS regions:

<Steps>
  1. **[AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/)** is only available in these regions:
     `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-2`,
     `eu-central-1`, `eu-west-1`, `eu-west-2`, `eu-west-3`,
     `ap-south-1`, `ap-southeast-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `ap-northeast-1`.
     We use App Runner for [RunsOn](/layers/github-actions/runs-on/), our recommended solution for self-hosted GitHub runners.
     Notably, **`us-west-1` does not support App Runner**.

  1. **[Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/)** is only available in these regions:
     `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-2`,
     `eu-central-1`, `eu-west-1`, `eu-west-2`,
     `ap-northeast-1`, `ap-northeast-2`, `ap-southeast-1`, `ap-southeast-2`.
     We use Managed Grafana for centralized monitoring dashboards in the
     [Grafana monitoring stack](/layers/monitoring/).
</Steps>

#### Deploying in Unsupported Regions

If your primary region doesn't support one of these services, you can still use that region by deploying the
service in a supported region and connecting it back:

- **App Runner / RunsOn**: Deploy RunsOn in a supported region and connect it to your primary region using
  [Transit Gateway](/components/library/aws/tgw/hub/) with a cross-region peering connection.
  This adds approximately **$80/month** in Transit Gateway cross-region data transfer costs.
- **Managed Grafana**: Deploy Grafana in a supported region and configure cross-region IAM roles to allow it
  to query data sources in your primary region.

For most deployments, we recommend choosing a primary region that supports all of these services to avoid additional
complexity and cost.

### Instance Types

Not all instance types are available in all regions

### Latency

Latency between v1 infrastructure and v2 infrastructure could be a factor. See
[cloudping.co/grid](https://www.cloudping.co/grid) for more information.
