## Problem

We need a domain that represents your branded domain in the live environment. This will be our synthetic production
domain since we do not want to interfere with any current production environments. Also, we do not want to use any
domains currently in use for any other purpose.

:::caution **IMPORTANT**

This is not the same as
[Decide on Service Discovery Domain](/layers/network/design-decisions/decide-on-service-discovery-domain).

:::

- These domains are for public-facing endpoints

- **Prevent devs from using logic jumps based on the domain instead of using feature flags**

- **Maintain symmetry with production** (e.g. if we have `acme.com` in production redirect to `www.acme.com`, we should
  be able to test/validate identical behavior with a top-level domain in staging and dev)

- `CNAME` **is not possible with a zone-apex, only** `A` **records**. (If we used `staging.acme.com`, we would
  technically want to use `www.staging.acme.com` for zone-apex parity and that just gets too long)

- **Cookie domain scope should only be for staging or production but not both.** Separate domains prevent this from
  happening. For example, if you set `Domain=acme.com`, cookies are available on subdomains like `staging.acme.com` and
  `www.acme.com`. Therefore, we want to avoid this possibility. We have seen this affect the ability to properly QA
  features.

- **CORS headers should prevent cross-origin requests from staging and product.** We want to prevent wildcards from
  permitting cross-staging requests which could lead to staging hammering production (vise versa)

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://*.acme.com
```

## Considerations

_Use one domain for each stage (prod, staging, dev, sandbox, etc)_

- This top-level domain will be delegated to each account as necessary. Typically including `prod`, `staging`, `dev`,
  and optionally `sandbox`.
- Our standard recommendation is to acquire a new domain with a regular TLD.
- One good convention is to use your namespace suffixed with `-prod` or `-staging`. e.g. `$namespace-$stage.com` would
  become `cpco-prod.com`, `cpco-staging.com`, `cpco-dev.com`

:::info

Remember, these are for synthetic testing of branded domain functionality, and not the _actual_ domains your customers
will be using.

## FAQ

### What are examples of vanity domains?

Think of vanity domains as all of your publicly branded properties. E.g. `apple.com` and `www.apple.com` and
`store.apple.com`.

### Why do we differentiate between vanity domains and service discovery domains?

It’s not uncommon that vanity domains are controlled by a different entity in the organization and may not even be
controlled using terraform or other IaC. Of course, we prefer to manage them with terraform using our
[dns-primary](/components/library/aws/dns-primary/) component, it’s not a _technical_ requirement.

### What’s the difference between vanity domains and service discovery domains?

Vanity domains are typically fronted by a CDN and then upstream to some load balancer (e.g. ALB). The load balancer on
the other hand will typically have a service discovery domain associated with it (e.g. `lb.uw2.prod.acme.org`). The
service discovery domain is a domain whose conventions we (operations teams) control (e.g. totally logical and
hierarchical with multiple zone delegations). While the vanity domains are governed by a different set of stakeholders
such as marketing, sales, legal, and SEO. You might have hundreds or thousands of vanity domains pointed to a single
service discovery domain.

### Why don’t we just use `staging.acme.com` and `dev.acme.com` as our vanity domains?

We want symmetry and this is not symmetrical to what you use currently in production. E.g. your production traffic
doesn’t go to `prod.acme.com`. It goes to `acme.com` or `www.acme.com`; so for the same reason, we want to have
something that symmetrical to `acme.com` for dev and staging purposes. Another example is a cookie set on `.acme.com`
will work for both `staging.acme.com` and `prod.acme.com`, and that's a bad thing from a testing perspective.
