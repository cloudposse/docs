## Deployment

Next, set up AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) to connect each desired AWS account to the private network by running the following command:

<AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/tgw" fileName="quickstart/foundation/network" />

This command will deploy the TGW hub and spokes to connect the network to the AWS accounts. The TGW hub is deployed in the `core-network` account, and the TGW spokes are deployed in each AWS account with a VPC.
