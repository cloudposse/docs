<Intro>
  Your platform ensures consistent service delivery every time. A well-designed platform seamlessly integrates with your monitoring, security, and compliance systems, building on your established foundation. Automated software delivery pipelines deploy new services quickly and easily. The reference architecture supports AWS EKS, Amazon ECS, and Lambda functions.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Container Orchestration

    Choose a path for consistent delivery of your services. The reference architecture supports AWS EKS, Amazon ECS, and Lambda functions.

      <TabItem value="ecs" label="Use ECS">
        Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully-managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. ECS makes it easy to run and manage Docker containers on AWS infrastructure, providing a secure and scalable platform for your applications. One of the major benefits of ECS over EKS, is that there is no need to upgrade the underlying platform. ECS is a managed service that is always up to date. This means that you can focus on your application and not the underlying platform.

      <TabItem value="eks" label="Use EKS">

        Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run Kubernetes in AWS cloud and on-premises data centers. AWS handles the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane, which oversees tasks such as scheduling containers, managing application availability, and storing cluster data. While AWS manages control plane upgrades, users are responsible for the worker nodes and the workloads running on them, including operators, controllers, and applications. We use Karpenter for managing node pools and support spot instances to optimize costs. Be aware that you'll need to upgrade the cluster quarterly due to the significant pace of Kubernetes innovation. Although EKS has a steeper learning curve compared to ECS, it offers greater flexibility and control, making it ideal for organizations already utilizing Kubernetes.

Once you're done setting up your platform, our attention will shift to how you ship your software by leveraging GitHub Actions and GitHub Action Workflows.
