<Intro>
Now that the GitHub OIDC Provider has been deployed, we can proceed with setting up the necessary prerequisites for containers. The first prerequisite is deploying Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories that will be used to store container images built by GitHub Actions workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ## <StepNumber/> Deploy ECR Repositories

  Deploy the ECR repositories that will be used by GitHub Actions workflows:

  <AtmosWorkflow workflow="deploy/ecr" fileName="baseline" />

  We use ECR for two main purposes:
  <Steps>
  1. Storing the Geodesic base image that provides the development environment and tooling
  2. Storing container images built during CI steps of application release workflows
  </Steps>
