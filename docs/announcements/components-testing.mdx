<Intro>
A couple of months ago we started a big project called "Components testing". The goal is to improve the stability of components, detect and fix integration errors, and pave the way for confident delivery of new features. Today, we are happy to announce that we have completed the second phase of this project - "Added automated testing for the first 27 components".
</Intro>

## Project Overview

In the first phase, we split the `cloudposse/terraform-aws-components` monorepo into dozens of repositories in the `cloudposse-terraform-components` github organization. We updated the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater` Github action, allowing you to smoothly migrate to new repositories. Hopefully you are already using components from the new organization.

## Progress Tracking

### Covered Components

### Project Status
We have also developed a testing framework, templates, and a step-by-step guide on writing component tests. You can follow the project status on this board https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse-terraform-components/projects/1/views/1
