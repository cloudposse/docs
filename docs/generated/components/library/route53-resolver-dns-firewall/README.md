```yaml
# stacks/catalog/route53-resolver-dns-firewall/defaults.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    route53-resolver-dns-firewall/defaults:
      metadata:
        type: abstract
      settings:
        spacelift:
          workspace_enabled: true
      vars:
        enabled: true
        firewall_fail_open: "ENABLED"
        query_log_enabled: true
        logs_bucket_component_name: "route53-resolver-dns-firewall-logs-bucket"
        domains_config:
          allowed-domains:
            # Concat the lists of domains passed in the `domains` field and loaded from the file `domains_file`
            # The file is in the `components/terraform/route53-resolver-dns-firewall/config` folder
            domains_file: "config/allowed_domains.txt"
            domains: []
          blocked-domains:
            # Concat the lists of domains passed in the `domains` field and loaded from the file `domains_file`
            # The file is in the `components/terraform/route53-resolver-dns-firewall/config` folder
            domains_file: "config/blocked_domains.txt"
            domains: []
        rule_groups_config:
          blocked-and-allowed-domains:
            # 'priority' must be between 100 and 9900 exclusive
            priority: 101
            rules:
              allowed-domains:
                firewall_domain_list_name: "allowed-domains"
                # 'priority' must be between 100 and 9900 exclusive
                priority: 101
                action: "ALLOW"
              blocked-domains:
                firewall_domain_list_name: "blocked-domains"
                # 'priority' must be between 100 and 9900 exclusive
                priority: 200
                action: "BLOCK"
                block_response: "NXDOMAIN"
```

```yaml
# stacks/mixins/stage/dev.yaml
import:
  - catalog/route53-resolver-dns-firewall/defaults

components:
  terraform:
    route53-resolver-dns-firewall/example:
      metadata:
        component: route53-resolver-dns-firewall
        inherits:
          - route53-resolver-dns-firewall/defaults
      vars:
        name: route53-dns-firewall-example
        vpc_component_name: vpc
