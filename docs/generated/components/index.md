This is a collection of reusable Terraform components and blueprints for provisioning reference architectures.

## Introduction

In this catalog you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented various common patterns using our [terraform modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) for our customers.

The component catalog captures the business logic, opinions, best practices and non-functional requirements.

It's from this catalog that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from anytime they need to deploy some new capability.

These components make a lot of assumptions about how we've configured our environments. That said, they can still serve as an excellent reference for others.
