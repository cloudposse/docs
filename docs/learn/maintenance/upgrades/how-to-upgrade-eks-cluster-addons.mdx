## Problem

EKS clusters support “Addons” that can be automatically installed on a cluster, but they also need to be kept up to date. AWS officially supports 3 cluster add-ons and they are not automatically updated when updating the EKS cluster:

- Amazon VPC CNI

- CoreDNS

- Kube-Proxy

See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html), for more.

## Solution

:::tip
Ensure all `addons` for the component use an `addon_version` that corresponds to the `cluster_kubernetes_version` using the `aws eks describe-addon-versions` command.

:::

:::caution
- Requires EKS Cluster Version **1.18** or greater. See [How to Upgrade EKS](/learn/maintenance/upgrades/how-to-upgrade-eks) On Upgrading your cluster!

- Requires `terraform-aws-eks-cluster` module version **0.43.0** or greater.  [https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster) which adds supports for `addons`

- Requires [eks/cluster](/components/library/aws/eks/cluster/)) component which maps `addons` to `var.addons`

:::

Adding the `addons` variable will enable the addons to your cluster. However, determining the `addon_version` can be difficult. It can be done through ClickOps, or through CLI.  When running `aws eks describe-addon-versions` make sure to specify the `--kubernetes-version` which corresponds to the `cluster_kubernetes_version` in the stack configuration.

See the “Troubleshooting” section, if you run into problems.

```
# Get all Addon Versions for All Plugins for kubernetes version 1.20
aws eks describe-addon-versions --kubernetes-version 1.20  | jq

# Get Latest Version for all Plugins for kubernetes version 1.20
aws eks describe-addon-versions --kubernetes-version 1.20  | jq '.addons[] | "\(.addonName) \(.addonVersions[0].addonVersion)"'
```

Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, it does not appear that there’s any `data` source in `terraform` to retrieve the latest version of addons. The `eks_addons` [data source](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/eks_addon) will only return information about the addons currently installed in an EKS cluster.

Note that the addon version may or may not include the kubernetes version. E.g. `kube-proxy` versions their releases according to kubernetes releases, but appends the `eksbuild.2` which will vary. The `vpc-cni`, however, has it’s own versioning cadence.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    eks:
      vars:
        cluster_kubernetes_version: "1.20"
        addons:
          - addon_name: "kube-proxy"
            addon_version: "v1.20.4-eksbuild.2"
            resolve_conflicts: "NONE"
            service_account_role_arn: null
          - addon_name: "vpc-cni"
            addon_version: "v1.9.1-eksbuild.1"
            resolve_conflicts: "NONE"
            service_account_role_arn: null
          - addon_name: "coredns"
            addon_version: "v1.8.3-eksbuild.1"
            resolve_conflicts: "NONE"
            service_account_role_arn: null
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `unexpected EKS Add-On (eg-uw2-tools-eks-cluster:kube-proxy) state returned during creation: unexpected state 'CREATE_FAILED', wanted target 'ACTIVE'`

```
│ Error: unexpected EKS Add-On (eg-uw2-tools-eks-cluster:kube-proxy) state returned during creation: unexpected state 'CREATE_FAILED', wanted target 'ACTIVE'. last error: 1 error occurred:
│ 	* : ConfigurationConflict: Apply failed with 1 conflict: conflict with "before-first-apply" using v1: .data.config
```

:::tip
The AWS API will run a first time script! This allows the addons to be created but will **FAIL** the first attempt through _spacelift_. If this happens Retry.

:::

:::note
This leaves the cluster addons in a `Create Failed` State, which does not appear to impact services
