## Problem

You are running an out-of-date version of atmos and need to upgrade it to leverage some new functionality.

## Solution

<Note title="TL;DR">
  Update the `ATMOS_VERSION` in the [Geodesic](/resources/legacy/fundamentals/geodesic) `Dockerfile` of your `infrastructure` repository.
</Note>

### Upgrading from 0.x.x → 1.x

:::note
To reduce the number of variables in case something breaks, please make sure all spacelift stacks are in a confirmed state.

:::

:::note
Terraform workspaces no longer are tied to root stack names and instead are created from context variables. For the rare scenarios where root stacks do not correlate to their pre-existing terraform workspaces and backwards compatibility is needed, `metadata.terraform_workspace` (1.3.20+) yaml key would need to be set to the name of the file (without .yaml) for each component in that root stack to prevent a destroy and recreate on each resource.

:::

:::caution
The administrative stack must have its runner image set to custom Geodesic image built by the monorepo and not the default Spacelift runner image. This is because upgrading to the latest `cloud-infrastructure-automation` module introduces the Cloud Posse’s `utils` provider, which requires `atmos.yaml`.

:::

<Steps>
  1. Update the `ATMOS_VERSION` in the [Geodesic](/resources/legacy/fundamentals/geodesic) `Dockerfile` of your `infrastructure` repository (see “Atmos Versions”)
  2. Remove `variant` installation from the Dockerfile

  3. Add `atmos.yaml` to  `rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml`
      - See [Atmos](/resources/legacy/fundamentals/atmos)  for example.

  4. In `rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml` file, review the following config:

      `excluded_paths` is a list of path globs that are NOT top-level stacks and should be excluded from searching by `atmos` (note that those stack config files are usually imported into top-level stacks).
      If, for example, the `catalog` folder is not used, but some other folder(s) are used to keep the imported files, remove the `"catalog/**/*"` item from the list and add the other folder(s) to exclude them.

      ```yaml
        excluded_paths:
          - "globals/**/*"
          - "catalog/**/*"
          - "**/*globals*"
      ```
  5. Review all other settings in `rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml`. For example, if `tenant` is not in use, modify `helm_aws_profile_pattern`, `cluster_name_pattern` and `name_pattern` settings.

  6. Upgrade [spacelift automation](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation) module to latest version in the `spacelift` component
      - Note that the version below shows 0.45.0 but this may not be the latest version
      - Remove the variable `var.stack_config_path` from `components/terraform/spacelift/variables.tf`
      - Remove the following two fields from the Spacelift module invocation and remove `locals`

        ```hcl
        stacks                     = local.stacks
        stack_config_path          = var.stack_config_path

        locals {
          config_filenames   = fileset(var.stack_config_path, "*.yaml")
          stack_config_files = [for f in local.config_filenames : f if(replace(f, "globals", "") == f)]
          stacks             = [for f in local.stack_config_files : trimsuffix(basename(f), ".yaml")]
        }
        ```
        <img src="/assets/refarch/image-20211216-233728.png" /><br/>

  7. Update the file `components/terraform/spacelift/context.tf` to the latest version (take it from [https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/blob/master/exports/context.tf](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/blob/master/exports/context.tf))

  8. Update the file `.spacelift/config.yml` with the following content

      ```yaml
      version: "1"

      stack_defaults:
        before_init:
          - spacelift-write-vars
          - spacelift-tf-workspace

        before_plan: []

        before_apply: []

        environment:
          AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG: true
          AWS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/aws-config/aws-config-cicd
          # replace <namespace> with your namespace and remove this comment
          AWS_PROFILE: <namespace>-gbl-identity
          ATMOS_BASE_PATH: /mnt/workspace/source

      stacks:
        infrastructure:
          before_init: []
          before_plan: []
          before_apply: []

      ```

  9. Update the file `rootfs/usr/local/bin/spacelift-tf-workspace` with the following content

      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash

      # Add -x for troubleshooting
      set -ex -o pipefail

      terraform init -reconfigure

      echo "Selecting Terraform workspace..."
      echo "...with AWS_PROFILE=$AWS_PROFILE"
      echo "...with AWS_CONFIG_FILE=$AWS_CONFIG_FILE"

      atmos terraform workspace "$ATMOS_COMPONENT" --stack="$ATMOS_STACK"

      # Remove -x for security
      set -e +x

      ```

  10. Update the file `rootfs/usr/local/bin/spacelift-write-vars` to look like the following

      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash

      # Add -x for troubleshooting
      set -ex -o pipefail

      function main() {
        if [[ -z $ATMOS_STACK ]] || [[ -z $ATMOS_COMPONENT ]]; then
          echo "Missing required environment variable" >&2
          echo "  ATMOS_STACK=$ATMOS_STACK" >&2
          echo "  ATMOS_COMPONENT=$ATMOS_COMPONENT" >&2
          return 3
        fi

        echo "Writing Stack variables to spacelift.auto.tfvars.json for Spacelift..."

        atmos terraform write varfile "$ATMOS_COMPONENT" \
          --stack="$ATMOS_STACK" -f spacelift.auto.tfvars.json > /dev/null
        jq . <spacelift.auto.tfvars.json
      }

      main

      # Remove -x for security
      set -e +x

      ```

  11. `Make sure the Spacelift scripts are executable` by running `chmod +x rootfs/usr/local/bin/spacelift*`

  12. Also change `remote-state.tf` for each component. Since the new atmos 1.x retrieves the stacks dynamically, we do

      Before in atmos 0.x

      ```hcl
      module "state" {
        source  = "cloudposse/stack-config/yaml//modules/remote-state"
        version = "0.19.0"

        stack_config_local_path = "../../../stacks"
        component               = lookup(each.value, "component", each.key)

        context = module.this.context
      }
      ```

      After in atmos 1.x (use the latest version of remote-state)

      ```hcl
      module "eks" {
        source  = "cloudposse/stack-config/yaml//modules/remote-state"
        # use the latest version
        version = "0.22.3"

        component = "eks"

        context = module.this.context
      }
      ```

      To script this, you can use [tfupdate](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfupdate) or [hcledit](https://github.com/minamijoyo/hcledit).

      hcledit (use the latest version of remote-state)

      ```bash
      apt update && apt install -y hcledit
      find . -name remote-state.tf > remote-state-files
      cat remote-state-files | \
        while read remotestatefile; do \
          hcledit block list --file $remotestatefile | \
            while read block; do \
              echo "hcledit attribute set $block.version '\"0.22.3\"' --file $remotestatefile -u"; \
              echo "hcledit attribute rm $block.stack_config_local_path --file $remotestatefile -u"; \
            done;
        done > update-remotestate.sh
      chmod +x update-remotestate.sh
      ./update-remotestate.sh
      ```

  13. Bump Geodesic to the latest like `1.2.1`. This is so the `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` env var no longer needs to be set

  14. Run `make all` to build a new container

  15. Change directory into the root path of your repository within `/localhost`

  16. Set the `export ATMOS_BASE_PATH=$(pwd)`env var if it’s not already set

  17. Run `atmos terraform plan vpc --stack <STACKNAME>` and other atmos commands as a test

  18. Open a pull request with the changes described above

  19. After approval, merge the PR into the default branch

  20. Rebuild the Docker image and push the latest version to the Docker registry used by Spacelift (usually ECR) with the tag `latest`. This is required for the changes to the Spacelift files in `rootfs/usr/local/bin/` to take effect, and is usually done by automation like calling a GitHub Actions or executing a Codefresh pipeline.

  21. Confirm that the `infrastructure` stack and components' stacks are operational in Spacelift
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

#### Failed local runs

```console
╷
│ Error:
│ No stack config files found in the provided paths:
│ - /localhost/git/infrastructure/components/terraform/compliance/stacks/**/*
```
This means that the `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` (different for everyone, should be set to the absolute path of the repo root) is most likely unset or an older version of `atmos` is used.

```console
$ atmos version
1.3.17
$ echo $ATMOS_BASE_PATH
/localhost/git/infrastructure/
```
If it still fails, try running an `atmos terraform clean` command to remove any stale data like a stale `.terraform.lock.hcl` file and rerun.

#### Failed Spacelift runs
Any stack failures may be due to stacks pinned to a specific old hash even if it points to the default branch. Each failed stack should point to the latest HEAD because the latest will contain the `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` env var set in the `.spacelift/config`.

To do this, for each failed stack

<Steps>
  1. Navigate to the stack
  2. Go to stack settings
  3. Change branch to something else
  4. Change it back to the original branch (like `main` or whatever the default branch is)
  5. Retrigger
</Steps>

and it should show up as “Unconfirmed” or “No changes” as expected.
