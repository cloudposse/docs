## Getting Started

To use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) we recommend interacting with the `atmos` command via `geodesic`.

:::info

Run all the following commands in the geodesic container from the Project root. e.g the _infrastructure_ repository. To run the geodesic shell run `make run` from the project root.

:::

The following assumes `<component>` is a folder that exists in `<ProjectDir>/components/terraform/`that contains .tf files to be applied.
e.g. `ecr`, `dns-primary`, `accounts` are examples of **components**.

And that a `<stack>` is the name of a stack that exists in `<ProjectDir/stacks/` with `.yaml` not included.
e.g. `gbl-security`, `uw2-audit` are examples of **stacks**

## Terraform

#### terraform plan

```
atmos terraform plan <component> -s <stack>
```

#### terraform apply

```
atmos terraform apply <component> -s <stack>
```

#### terraform destroy

```
atmos terraform destroy <component> -s <stack>
```

#### terraform force-unlock

```
cd components/terraform/<component>
terraform force-unlock -force <LockID>
cd ../../../
```

#### terraform apply -auto-approve
This command is used for planning and applying in the same command.

```
atmos terraform deploy <component> -s <stack>
```
