## Problem

We want to deploy a component or set of to multiple regions. The components might need specific settings depending on the region. We want to be as DRY as possible but not compromise on the customization of the configuration.

## Solution

First, make sure you’re familiar with [Stacks](/reference/legacy/fundamentals/stacks) and [How to Use Imports and Catalogs in Stacks](/learn/maintenance/tutorials/how-to-use-imports-and-catalogs-in-stacks) with [Components](/components) Inheritance.

:::tip
Define one stack configuration for every region and simply import the catalog configuration with all components you want to re-use per region.

:::

Let’s say we want to deploy the [vpc](/components/library/aws/vpc/) into the AWS `us-east-1` and `us-west-2` regions in the `dev` account. We’ll want to customize the CIDR block, region, and availability zones used. Here’s how to do it...

<Steps>
  1. Define a catalog entry for the common `vpc` configuration. This is where we can define our organizations best-practices for a VPC.

      ```yaml
      # stacks/catalog/vpc.yaml
      components:
        terraform:
          vpc:
            backend:
              s3:
                workspace_key_prefix: vpc
            settings:
              spacelift:
                workspace_enabled: true
            vars:
              enabled: true
              subnet_type_tag_key: acme.net/subnet/type
              vpc_flow_logs_enabled: true
              #vpc_flow_logs_bucket_environment_name: uw2
              vpc_flow_logs_bucket_stage_name: audit
              vpc_flow_logs_bucket_tenant_name: mgmt
              vpc_flow_logs_traffic_type: ALL
      ```

  2. Now define a stack configuration for the `us-east-1` region.

      ```yaml
      # stacks/ue1-dev.yaml
      import:
      - catalog/vpc

      # Define the global variables for this region
      vars:
        region: us-east-1
        environment: ue1

      components:
        terraform:
          vpc:
            vars:
              cidr_block: 10.1.0.0/18
              vpc_flow_logs_bucket_environment_name: ue1
              availability_zones:
                - "us-east-1a"
                - "us-east-1b"
                - "us-east-1c"
      ```

  3. Then repeat the process and define a stack configuration for the `us-west-2` region.

      ```yaml
      # stacks/uw2-dev.yaml
      import:
      - catalog/vpc

      # Define the global variables for this region
      vars:
        region: us-west-2
        environment: uw2

      components:
        terraform:
          vpc:
            vars:
              cidr_block: 10.2.0.0/18
              vpc_flow_logs_bucket_environment_name: uw2
              availability_zones:
                - "us-west-2a"
                - "us-west-2b"
                - "us-west-2c"
      ```
</Steps>

Now use the standard [Atmos](/reference/legacy/fundamentals/atmos) commands to plan and apply the stack configurations.
