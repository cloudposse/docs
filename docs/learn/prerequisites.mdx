<Intro>
  Before we start provisioning the reference architecture, ensure you have sufficient cloud access to provision the resources and that your local workstation has the necessary software installed.
</Intro>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Obtain Cloud Access

    If you're provisioning the infrastructure from scratch, you'll need the AWS root account credentials as part of the bootstrapping process before AWS Single Sign-On is set up. If you're working within an existing organization, ensure you have sufficient access to the accounts you'll be managing.
    <TaskList>
      - [ ] AWS SSO Access (talk to your AWS administrator)
      - [ ] Ensure you can log in to AWS. See
            [How to Use Leapp to Authenticate with AWS](/layers/identity/tutorials/leapp) to get
            started.
    </TaskList>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Setup Your Workstation

    Prerequisites for your local host computer:
      <TaskList>
      - [ ] Docker installed (to run our tools)
      - [ ] Slack installed (to communicate with our team)
      - [ ] `make` installed, preferably GNU Make
      - [ ] `git` installed
      - [ ] [Leapp](/layers/identity/tutorials/leapp) for authentication
      - [ ] Infrastructure Git repo cloned
    </TaskList>

        ### Homebrew Users

        We typically ship a `Brewfile` with a list of local dependencies. Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and use
        `brew bundle` to install dependencies from the `Brewfile`
        <Steps>
          1. First, make sure you’ve [cloned the `infrastructure` repository](/layers/foundation/create-repository) for your organization.
          2. Just run `brew bundle install` to install all localhost dependencies. Here's an example `Brewfile`:

              ```shell
              brew "atmos"
              brew "coreutils"
              brew "pre-commit"
              brew "terraform-docs"
              brew "opentofu"
              brew "tflint"
              ```

          3. Next, you'll need docker set up. There are a variety of ways to do this. Review the [Docker for Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) installation guide for macOS.
        </Steps>

        ### Docker on Windows

        ##### Setting up containers on Windows

        <Steps>
          1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or install
            [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and configure it to use `docker` instead of `nerdctl`.
          1. If you picked Docker Desktop, follow [instructions on WSL setup](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/), otherwise
            follow [Rancher's setup docs](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/ui/preferences/wsl).
        </Steps>

        ##### Using Ubuntu on Windows

        <Steps>
          1. First, [setup WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and then configure WSL to use version
            2 by default with this command: `wsl --set-default-version 2`
          1. [Install Ubuntu for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)
          1. [Install Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)
          1. Launch Ubuntu shell from Windows Terminal
          1. [Add user to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
          1. If you chose to use Rancher, just install `docker`. If you chose to use Docker Desktop, you'll need to go into
            settings and enable your Ubuntu distro. Once applied, you'll see `docker` available in your Ubuntu shell `PATH`.
        </Steps>

        ##### Running Geodesic on Windows

        <Steps>
          1. You'll need an editor that supports WSL2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and most JetBrains IDEs support
            WSL2 using remote development plugins.
          1. Clone this repo into your WSL2 environment
          1. Install `curl` and `build-essential` with `apt-get`
          1. Launch your editor's remote development mode and open the repo
          1. You should now be able to run `make all` and have it build the container and launch a shell inside it
        </Steps>

        #### Docker on Linux Systems

        You should be able to use `docker` as normal. Launch docker before running the `Makefile`.

        Linux users should run Docker in ["rootless"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) mode. In this mode, the Docker daemon runs as the host user (rather than as root) and files created by the root user in Geodesic are owned by the host user on the host. Not only does this configuration solve [this issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic/issues/594), but it provides much better system security overall.

<ActionCard title="What comes next?">
  With your repository set up, you’re ready to configure the toolbox container. This container, based on Geodesic, will provide you with an interactive and consistent environment to execute all the necessary commands in the upcoming steps. In the next step, you’ll dive deeper into Geodesic and its powerful features.
