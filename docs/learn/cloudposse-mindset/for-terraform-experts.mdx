As an expert terraformer, you've seen it allâ€”you know what works and what doesn't. You've faced the challenges of using Terraform in production and developed your own set of best practices. You understand that Terraform is just a tool, with its effectiveness determined by how it's used. While it works well on a small scale, things get complex at larger scales. Many companies struggle with Terraform because they don't adopt a consistent framework, which we believe is a fundamental issue.

You could build your own framework, but it would take years, just as it did for us. Many underestimate the value of comprehensive documentation, established conventions, and the ongoing effort to maintain both. By joining the Cloud Posse ecosystem, you get all of this for free, for life, under the Apache 2 Permissive Open Source License.

Cloud Posse is opinionated, and that's a good thing. Our approach benefits from significant investment and real-world use cases. While we have strong opinions, we've also built flexibility into the system. We prioritize convention over configuration to reduce complexity and cognitive load. By investing a little time upfront to learn our conventions, you'll unlock immense power and efficiency.
