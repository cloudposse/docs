Before you jump into the Cloud Posse reference architecture, let’s review what makes it tick. Cloud Posse has been helping companies—from scrappy startups to massive enterprises—win big with Terraform. But here’s the kicker: we do things differently. Everything is based on Open Source that your team owns and operates. We're not another enterprise platform you have to pay for. We’re a community that’s here to help you succeed.

Our goal? To create a collaborative ecosystem where everyone, regardless of the company, can work together on infrastructure, so we stop reinventing the wheel.

How do we make this magic happen? First, we built the industry's largest library of Terraform modules for AWS, Datadog, and Opsgenie. Then, we crafted reusable components to give you rock-solid ways to set up your infrastructure. Finally, we wrapped it all up in a neat framework called [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) that ties everything together.

Whether you’re a developer with years of experience, a Terraform newbie, or a seasoned Terraformer, there’s a way for you to grow with us and get exactly what you need without sacrificing customization. Stick around as we break it all down for you below.
