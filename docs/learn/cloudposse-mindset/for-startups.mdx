<Intro>
As a start-up, survival is your main goal, and our reference architecture—backed by extensive experience and contributions from a thriving community—provides essential support and scalability without long-term commitments. Whether through our free, open-source ecosystem or our tailored Quick Start and Jump Start solutions, we help you navigate the risks and achieve success efficiently.
</Intro>

As a start-up, whether bootstrapped or venture-backed, your primary goal is survival, which is no easy feat given that 99% of companies fail due to the inherent risks of starting from scratch. When you use our reference architecture, it's one less thing for you to worry about. With extensive experience working with a range of companies—from small, family-funded startups to $1 billion unicorns—we've developed a reference architecture that incorporates their invaluable investments and insights. These companies not only use our architecture but also actively contribute to its improvement through support and pull requests, creating a thriving ecosystem similar to those seen with Node, React, and Angular.

Our framework provides the essential support and community needed for modern software applications without binding you to long-term commitments. The open-source nature of our reference architecture means that it's continuously enhanced by companies like yours, either through direct contributions or by simply opting into the community when they can.

We specialize in optimizing for the tools most popular with startups, such as AWS, Datadog, and GitHub Actions, and understand the high standards required for release engineering and CI/CD. Being part of a community, much like accelerators and incubators, is crucial for startups, and our ecosystem offers that support for free.

When you're ready to scale or need additional help, we offer consulting support through professional services. For those looking to get up and running quickly, we have two solutions: Quick Start, a self-guided DIY implementation tailored to your specific needs, and Jump Start, an accelerated implementation completed in two to four weeks with a guaranteed outcome and a no-hassle money-back guarantee.
