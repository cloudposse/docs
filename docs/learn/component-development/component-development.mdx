# The Problem

While all companies are unique, their infrastructure doesn't need to be. Well-built infrastructure consists of reusable building blocks that implement all the standard components like servers, clusters, load balancers, etc. Rather than building everything from scratch “the hard way”, there's an easier way. Using our “reference architecture” and its service catalog of all the essential pieces of infrastructure, everything a business needs can be composed together as an architecture using “Stack” configurations. Best of all, it's all native terraform.

# Our Solution

Cloud Posse defines components. Components are opinionated, self-contained building blocks of Infrastructure-as-Code
(IAC) that solve one specific problem or use-case. Components are similar to a Terraform root module and define a set of
resources for any deployment.

- Terraform components live under the `components/terraform` directory.
- Cloud Posse maintains a collection of public components with
  [`terraform-aws-components`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components)
- The best components are generic enough to be reused in any organization, but there's nothing wrong with writing
  specialized components for your company.
- Detailed documentation for using components with Atmos can be found under
  [atmos.tools Core Concepts](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/)

:::info Pro tip!

We recommend that you always check first with Cloud Posse to see if we have an existing component before writing your
own. Sometimes we have work that has not yet been upstreamed to our public repository.

:::

## Prerequisites

In order to be able to create a new component, this document assumes the developer has the following requirements:

<TaskList>
  - [ ] Authentication to AWS, typically with Leapp
  - [ ] The infrastructure repository cloned locally
  - [ ] Geodesic up and running
  - [ ] A basic understanding of Atmos
  - [ ] An intermediate understanding of Terraform
</TaskList>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Create the component in Terraform
    <Steps>
      - Make a new directory in `components/terraform` with the name of the component
      - Add the files that should typically be in all components:

        ```console
        .
        ├── README.md
        ├── component.yaml # if vendoring from cloudposse
        ├── context.tf
        ├── main.tf
        ├── outputs.tf
        ├── providers.tf
        ├── remote-state.tf
        ├── variables.tf
        └── versions.tf
        ```

        All the files above should look familiar to Terraform developers, except for a few of the following.

        <dl>
          <dt>`context.tf`</dt>
          <dd>
            Cloud Posse uses `context.tf` to consistently set metadata across all resources. The `context.tf` is always identical. Copy it exactly from [here](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/blob/master/exports/context.tf).
            ```bash
            curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/master/exports/context.tf -o context.tf
            ```
          </dd>
          <dt>`providers.tf`</dt>
          <dd>
            - For `providers.tf`, if we are just using AWS providers only, copy it from [our common files (commonly referred to as mixins) folder](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/mixins/providers.depth-1.tf).
            - If we are using Kubernetes, then you may need an additional providers file for Helm and Kubernetes providers. Also copy this file from [the mixins folder](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/mixins/provider-helm.tf).
          </dd>
          <dt>`remote-state.tf`</dt>
          <dd>
            By convention, we use this file when we want to pull Terraform Outputs from other components. See [the `remote-state` Module](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state).
          </dd>
          <dt>`component.yaml`</dt>
          <dd>
            The component manifest is used for vendoring the latest version from Cloud Posse. More on this later.
          </dd>
        </dl>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Add Terraform Modules or Resources

    - In your `main.tf`, or other file names of your choosing, add configurations of Terraform modules and/or resources
      directly.
    - When you use a Cloud Posse module, you should **pass the context metadata into the module**, like
      [this](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/modules/s3-bucket/main.tf#L35). All Cloud
      Posse modules have the variable `context`, which you pass `module.this.context`
    - You could also use other external modules that are not provided by Cloud Posse.
    - Use `module.this.tags` when you want to pass a list of tags to a resources or module not provided by Cloud Posse. Tags
      are already included with `var.context` for any Cloud Posse module.
      <Admonition type="tip">
        Cloud Posse has a lot of open source modules, so [check here first](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/cloudposse) to avoid repeating existing effort.
      </Admonition>
    - Handle the variable `module.this.enabled`, so that resources are not created when `var.enabled` is set to `false`.
      Cloud Posse modules will do this automatically when passed `var.context`. When adding a resource or using a non-Cloud
      Posse module, then configure enabled with a count, for example `count = module.this.enabled ? 1 : 0`
    - Use
      [`remote-state`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cloudposse/stack-config/yaml/latest/submodules/remote-state) to
      read Terraform Output from other components.
      [For example the `eks/alb-controller` component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/master/modules/eks/alb-controller/remote-state.tf)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Configure Stacks


    <Steps>
      ### Directory Structure

      - Put all Stack configurations in the `stacks` directory

        ```
        stacks/
        ├── catalog/
        ├── mixins/
        ├── orgs/
        └── workflows/
        ```
      - Default configurations for a component live in the `catalog` directory, and configurations for deployed accounts live
        in the `orgs` directory.
      - All files in the `catalog` and `orgs` directories are **stack configuration files**. Read on for more information.
    </Steps>


    <Steps>
      ### Define defaults for a component in the `catalog` directory

      - The Stack Catalog is used to define a component's default configuration for a specific organization. Define variables
        that would not be shared in an Open Source setting here.
      - By convention, name the configuration the same as your component. For example, if your component is
        `components/terraform/foobar` then the file would be named `stacks/catalog/foobar.yaml`
        ```yaml
        components:
          terraform:
            foobar:
        ```
      - Above, `foobar` is the name of the component.
      - Pass variables into Terraform like this:
        ```yaml
        components:
          terraform:
            foobar:
              vars:
                sample_variable_present_in_variables_tf_of_component: "hello-world"
        ```
    </Steps>


    <Steps>
      ### Component Types

      - Atmos supports component types with the `metadata.type` parameter
      - There are two types of components:
        <dl>
          <dt>real</dt>
          <dd>is a "concrete" component instance</dd>
          <dt>abstract</dt>
          <dd>a component configuration, which cannot be instantiated directly. The concept is borrowed from
            [abstract base classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type) of Object Oriented Programming.</dd>
        </dl>
      - By default, all components are `real`
      - Define an `abstract` component by setting `metadata.type` to `abstract`. See the following example

        ```yaml
        components:
          terraform:
            foobar/defaults: # We can name this anything
              metadata:
                type: abstract # This is what makes the component `abstract`
                component: foobar # This needs to match exactly an existing component name
              vars:
                tags:
                  team: devops
        ```

        For more details, see [atmos.tools](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/inheritance)

      - With an `abstract` component default, we can inherit default settings for any number of derived components. For
        example:

          ```yaml
          components:
            terraform:
              foobar: # Since this component name matches exactly, we do not need to add `metadata.component`
                metadata:
                  type: real # This is the default value and is only added for visibility
                  inherits:
                    - foobar/defaults # The name of the `abstract` component
                vars:
                  sample_variable_present_in_variables_tf_of_component: "hello-world"
          ```
          Now `foobar` will uses the same configuration as `foobar/defaults` but may describe additional variables.
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Add Component Imports

    - In a stack configuration file, we can import other stack configuration files with `import`
    - When a file is imported, the YAML from that file is deep merged on top of earlier imports. This is the same idea as
      merging two dictionaries together.
    - Stack configurations can import each other as needed, and there can be multiple layers or different hierarchies of
      configurations
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy Components with a Stack

    - In the directory corresponding to the environment you want to deploy in, for example
      `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/sandbox/us-east-1/`, add a new file (or adding to an existing file) your component by importing
      it from the catalog.

      ```yaml
      import:
        # These two imports add default variables
        - orgs/acme/plat/sandbox/_defaults
        - mixins/region/us-east-1
        # This imports a real component, which will deploy even if we do not
        # inherit from it or override any values.
        - catalog/foobar
      ```

    - In the above example, we have imported the `foobar` catalog configuration into the `plat-use1-sandbox` environment
      into a new YAML file of any name. For example `foobar.yaml`

      ```yaml
      import:
        - orgs/acme/plat/sandbox/_defaults
        - mixins/region/us-east-1
        - catalog/foobar

      components:
        terraform:
          foobar:
            vars:
              sample_variable_present_in_variables_tf_of_component: "env-specific-config"
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Deploy

    Now that the component is [(1) defined in Terraform](#create-the-component-in-terraform),
    [(2) created in Atmos](#catalog-stacks), and [(3) imported in the target Stack](#deploy-components-with-a-stack), now
    deploy the component with Atmos.

    ```
    atmos terraform apply foobar -s plat-use1-sandbox
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Vendoring

Atmos supports component vendoring. We use vendor to pull a specific version of the component from
[the upstream library](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components).

When vendoring a component,
<Steps>
  1. Create a branch of your repository
  2. Add a `component.yaml` file to the components directory
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: atmos/v1
      kind: ComponentVendorConfig
      spec:
        source:
          uri: github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/foobar?ref={{ .Version }}
          version: 1.160.0
          included_paths:
            - "**/**"
          excluded_paths: []
      ```
  3. Fill out the `component.yaml` with the latest version from
    [the upstream library](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components)
  4. Run the vendor commands: `atmos vendor pull --component foobar`
  5. Create a Pull Request to check for changes against any existing component. Keep in mind vendoring will overwrite any
    custom changes to existing files upstream.
</Steps>

## Next Steps

At this point, your component is complete in code, but there is still more to do!

<Steps>
  1. Run precommit Terraform docs and linting against the new component
  2. Add your new component to your GitOps automation tooling, such as Spacelift
  3. Configure `CODEOWNERS` for the new component, if necessary
  4. Documentation!
</Steps>
