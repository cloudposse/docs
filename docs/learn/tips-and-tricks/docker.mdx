Here's a collection of some nice little hacks for docker. A lot of them are related to house keeping.

## Docker Stats

Produce console stats for all running containers (e.g. like `top`):

```shell
docker stats $(docker ps --format='{{.Names}}'
```

## Remove all stopped containers

```shell
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

## Remove all untagged images

```shell
docker images -q --filter "dangling=true" | xargs docker rmi
```

## Prune everything

The docker system prune command is a shortcut that prunes images, containers, and networks.

:::info
- In Docker `17.06.0` and earlier, volumes are also pruned.
- In Docker `17.06.1` and higher, you must specify the `--volumes` flag for docker system prune to prune volumes.
:::

```shell
$ docker system prune

WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
```

If you are on Docker `17.06.1` or higher and want to also prune volumes, add the `--volumes` flag:

```shell
$ docker system prune --volumes

WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all volumes not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
```

By default, you are prompted to continue which can be bypassed by adding the `-f` or `--force` flag.

## Simulate Multiple Inheritance

Docker doesn't technically support multiple-inheritance, whereby an image can automatically merge multiple images using `FROM`. It does, however, support [multi-stage builds](/reference/best-practices/docker-best-practices.md#multi-stage-builds) that can be used to effectiely achive the same result.
