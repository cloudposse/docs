## Tips & Tricks

### Write Complex Steps in `github-script`

Rather than try some impossible concoction of YAML, use typescript to define your CI/CD logic.

[https://github.com/actions/github-script](https://github.com/actions/github-script)

### Easily Write Files in Workflows

The `1arp/create-a-file-action` action is convenient for writing files.

```
    - name: Create ${{ steps.vars.outputs.argocd_app_root }}/config.yaml
      uses: 1arp/create-a-file-action@0.2
      with:
        path: "some/dir"
        file: config.yaml
        content: |
          name: "${{ github.event.deployment.payload.app }}"
          manifests: "${{ steps.vars.outputs.argocd_app_manifests }}"
          namespace: "${{ inputs.namespace }}"
```

### Checkout and Run Private GitHub Actions

:::info
**GitHub Enterprise** users can now use private actions natively within the organization.

[https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-21-share-github-actions-within-your-enterprise/](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-21-share-github-actions-within-your-enterprise/)

:::

```
      - name: Checkout Shared Actions
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          repository: acme/actions
          path: ./.github/actions
          token: ${{ secrets.CROSS_REPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Hello World
        uses: ./.github/actions/hello-world
        id: hello-world
```

### Use Empty Commits to Trigger Actions

```
git commit --allow-empty --message 'bump'
```

### Use `workflow_dispatch` to Manually Trigger Workflows

In this example, the workflow will trigger on `workflow_dispatch` and prompt the user to enter the required input for `delete`.  Note, `delete` is just an example; the input parameters can be whatever you want.

```
on:
  # Enable manual runs
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      delete:
        description: 'Set to "true" to actually delete stuff'
        required: true
        default: 'false'
```

## Known Limitations

There are a lot of _non-obvious_ limitations when working with GitHub Actions. Here are the ones we’ve been bit by in developing workflows. Also, make sure to check out the [Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/2?filterQuery=label%3Aactions) for GHA.

### Roadmap Items

These are some roadmap items we’re excited to see implemented:

- [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/52](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/52)

- [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/575](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/575)

- [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/199](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/199)

- [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/503](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/503)

### General

- Set in GitHub Actions running on self-hosted runner hangs indefinitely. Nothing meaningful in logs. The issue may be due to higher resource requirements for the `summerwind/actions-runner-dind` GHA runner. Increasing the resources may resolve the issue.

- Not all event types will run off of branches. Learn more here [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows)

- A single workflow cannot build and then `use` the derived docker image. Docker image must exist before workflow is started.

- Workflow approval steps are a GitHub Enterprise feature. [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments)

- GitHub Actions can only be used from public repos unless using GitHub Enterprise with an “enterprise” account to support `internal` (not “private”) repositories. To use in private repos, you need to `git clone` the repo and `use` the local path to the action.
[https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-21-share-github-actions-within-your-enterprise/](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-21-share-github-actions-within-your-enterprise/)
[https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/254](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/254)

[https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/74](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/74)

- GitHub Actions cron jobs automatically disable after 60 days of inactivity (no new commits) [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow)

- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to only permit operations on the _current_ repo of the GitHub Action workflow

- No ternary operator [https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/409](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/409)

- No way to restrict who can edit workflows to a subset of users with write permissions[https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/494](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/494)

### Composite Actions

- ~~Composite actions do not support~~ `if` conditional. [https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/834](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/834)
Update! Released 2021-11-09 [https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-09-github-actions-conditional-execution-of-steps-in-actions/](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-09-github-actions-conditional-execution-of-steps-in-actions/)

- Composite actions do not support post-run capabilities [https://github.community/t/no-post-run-capability-for-composite-actions/139046/4](https://github.community/t/no-post-run-capability-for-composite-actions/139046/4)

- ~~Composite actions cannot call other composite actions~~
[https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/862](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/862)

- [https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/665](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/665)

- [https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1348](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1348)

### Shared Workflows

- GitHub Actions shared workflows can only be private in GitHub Enterprise using an `internal` (not `private`) repo.. [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows)

- Private reusable workflows is in the GitHub Roadmap [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/51](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/51)

- Reusable workflows can't call other reusable workflows.

- Reusable workflows stored within a private repository can only be used by workflows within the same repository (unless using GitHub Enterprise).

- Any environment variables set in an `env` context defined at the workflow level in the caller workflow are not propagated to the called workflow. For more information about the `env` context, see "[Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#env-context)."

- You can't set the concurrency of a called workflow from the caller workflow. For more information about `jobs.<job_id>.concurrency`, see "[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idconcurrency)."

- The `strategy` property is not supported in any job that calls a reusable workflow.
