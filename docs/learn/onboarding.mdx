<Intro>
  This guide is intended to help new developers get up to speed with the Cloud Posse reference architecture. It covers the basics of the architecture, how to get started, and how to contribute. We assume you have a basic understanding of Terraform and AWS. We assume you are joining a team that is already using the Cloud Posse reference architecture that's been fully implemented in your AWS organization.
</Intro>

This guide assumes you have the following:

- Terraform experience working with modules, providers, public registry, state backends, etc
- AWS experience including a firm understanding of general concepts, IAM, the web console, etc
- Existing AWS environment utilizing Cloud Posse's reference architecture

If this all sounds a little bit daunting, you may want to start by reviewing the [Learning Resources](/resources/legacy/learning-resources).

If you're new to Terraform, we recommend starting with the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started).
