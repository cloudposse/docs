<Intro>
  This guide is intended to help new developers get up to speed with the Cloud Posse reference architecture. It covers the basics of the architecture, how to get started, and how to contribute. We assume you have a basic understanding of Terraform and AWS. We assume you are joining a team that is already using the Cloud Posse reference architecture that's been fully implemented in your AWS organization.
