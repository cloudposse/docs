<Intro>
Cloud Posse is an **open source company**. Everything we develop is open source and free to use under permissive licenses, but **Support is not included**.

## Getting Help

We have a [Slack community](https://cloudposse.com/slack) and a [GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/discussions) for questions and collaboration relating to our open source projects.

### Recommended etiquette:

- **Ask one question at a time** — split complex topics into separate posts.
- **Keep it high-level and clear** — we prioritize general questions that help the broader community.
- **Deeper technical or commercial-related questions** may be answered from time to time, **solely at our discretion**.

## Free Tier Support

**Free Tier Support does not include** support for:

- [Quickstart](/quickstart), [Jumpstart](/jumpstart), or other Commercial Reference Architectures
- [Cloud Posse Components](/components)
- [GitHub Actions and workflows](/github-actions)
- **Deliverables from paid implementations or services**

Our projects are open source and free to use — **but support is not included**.

We occasionally answer complex or commercial-related questions here, but this is voluntary and unscheduled. If your team depends on our work, we strongly encourage you to [subscribe to premium support](https://cloudposse.com/support).

**That’s what makes open source work.**
