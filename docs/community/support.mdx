Here are some quick answers to frequently asked questions. See also our [Troubleshooting](/resources/legacy/troubleshooting).

## How can we support you?

By far, the hardest part of being an open-source company is surviving the financial reality that very few companies ever pay for open source. Any financial contribution you can make helps us continue operating as a business, and we've made this easy through GitHub sponsorships.

## How do I request additional documentation?

Please request documentation by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/docs/issues). Please provide as much detail as possible about what you would like to see documented and what related documents you discovered that were not helpful.

## Are there paid support options?

Yes, we offer [multiple support options](/support) to fit your needs and budget. We accept payment via [AWS IQ](https://cloudposse.com/awsiq), [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=81c20b9c-5946-4909-8079-ff84dbb840ee), and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/cloudposse).

If you're benefiting from what we build here and your business depends on it, this is a great way to get both the help you need and to support our Open Source.
