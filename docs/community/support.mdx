# FAQ
Here are some quick answers to frequently asked questions. See also our [Troubleshooting](/reference-architecture/reference/troubleshooting).

## How can we support you?

By far, the hardest part of being an open-source company is surviving the financial reality that very few companies ever pay for open source. Any financial contribution you can make helps us continue operating as a business, and we've made this easy through GitHub sponsorships.

## How do I request additional documentation?

Please request documentation by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/docs/issues). Please provide as much detail as possible about what you would like to see documented and what related documents you discovered that were not helpful.

## Are there paid support options?

Yes, we offer [Customer Workshops](/quickstart/support) support via [GitHub Sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/cloudposse). With workshops, you can ask questions and get help directly from our engineers.

If you're benefiting from what we build here and your business depends on it, this is a great way to get both the help you need and to support our Open Source. Discuss the possibility of a [GitHub sponsorship of Cloud Posse](/quickstart) with your management! This sponsorship includes access to our [twice-weekly customer workshops](/quickstart/support), where you can ask questions and get help directly from our engineers.
