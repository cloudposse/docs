## About

This document is intended to describe common and not-so-common processes that the contributor team executes as part of maintaining the 300+ open source projects within the Cloud Posse Organization.


## Tips & Tricks

### Update Multiple Repos at Once

To update many of the open source repos with a common change such as updating Terraform `required_version` pinning, adding GitHub actions, or updating pinned providers, the contributor team has adopted using [microplane](https://github.com/Clever/microplane). This tool allows us to execute automated changes across dozens or even hundreds of our open source repos, which saves many hours of contributor time.

Here is a standard usage pattern that contributors can adopt to specific changes as they see fit:

<Steps>
  1. [Download the microplane binary from their releases page](https://github.com/Clever/microplane/releases)
  1. Open your terminal, rename and add the downloaded binary into your $PATH, and add execution privileges to the binary:
    1. `mv ~/Downloads/mp-0.0.21-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mp && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/mp`
  1. Add a [GH Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to your shell's environment variables under the variable `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`:
    1. `export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=$YOUR_TOKEN`
  1. Change to an empty directory that you can use as a scratch workspace for your Many Repos change:
    1. `mkdir ~/mp_workspace && cd ~/mp_workspace`
  1. Initialize microplane:
    1. `mp init --all-repos "cloudposse"`
    1. Initializing creates an `mp/` folder in your current directoy, finds all of the Cloud Posse public projects, and then creates an `mp/init.json` file describing them.
    1. NOTE: microplane supposedly has the ability to search against an organization and narrow the returned repos that end up in `init.json`, but that functionality seems buggy and not working. We do our repo filtering manually in the next step.
  1. Manually edit `mp/init.json` to only include the repos which you want to make changes against.
    1. Your editor's multi-select and edit capabilities are your friend here! (or maybe some [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) if that's your thing)
    1. Duplicate the original `init.json` so you don't need to re-run `mp init` in the case that you want to start fresh.
  1. Run microplane's clone command to pull all of the repos specified in `init.json` down to your local machine for mass changes:
    1. `mp clone`
  1. Create a bash script to facilitate the changes that you're attempting to make against the many repos you've specified.
    <Steps>
      1. Use the microplane `-r` or `--repo` flag to operate on a single repo for testing your script prior to making the changes across all repos.
      1. Go through the full microplane process (complete the following steps) for this single repo test-run and get it signed off by the other Cloud Posse `#contributors` to ensure everyone agrees with the change prior to making it.
    </Steps>
  1. Once you've got a script that is working like you expect, you can run the microplane plan command. This step executes the given script across all the repos specified in `init.json` and then commits the result. You should format your `mp plan` command as follows:
      ```bash
      mp plan -b $YOUR_BRANCH_NAME -m "[AUTOMATED] $YOUR_PR_TITLE

      ## What

      1. $INFO_ON_YOUR_CHANGE_NUMBER_ONE
      1. $INFO_ON_YOUR_CHANGE_NUMBER_TWO

      ## Why

      1. $INFO_ON_WHY_YOU_MADE_YOUR_CHANGE_NUMBER_ONE
      1. $INFO_ON_WHY_YOU_MADE_YOUR_CHANGE_NUMBER_TWO" \
      -- \
      sh -c $PWD/$YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME.sh
      ```

      __NOTE__ the quotes around the message passing this as an argument to `-m` (message)
  1. Verify one of the repos that you're updating exemplifies the changes you're trying to make:
    1. `cd mp/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend/plan/planned/`
    1. `git show`
    1. Confirm the changes and commit message that you see are what you want to push.
  1. If everything looks legit, ship it:
    1. `mp push -a $YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`
</Steps>

That should cycle through all of the repos in `init.json`, pushing them to the branch you specified, and creating a PR against the `master` branch. Now go forth and run `/test all` against all of those PRs and ask some kind soul to help you get them merged ðŸ˜Ž.
