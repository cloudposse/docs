## Our Commitment

We commit to always provide free and public access to our Open Source repositories. If you see repository on our GitHub today, then it will be here tomorrow and thereafter in perpetuity.

From time to time, we might decide we can no longer maintain a repository. If that happens, we will mark it as "archived" on GitHub. This will ensure you will continue to have access to the code.

## Getting Involved

The best way to get involved is to checkout our "[Choose Your Path](/intro/path/)" guide.

Then join us in our Slack [`#community`](https://cloudposse.com/slack/) channel to get support or talk with others in the community.

## Contributing

Cloud Posse accepts contributions from the community. In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we have a strict [code of conduct](/community/code-of-conduct) to ensure participation in our projects and our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone.

If you want to make some big changes or don't know where to begin, it's best to first get in touch. You can discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub issues, [email](mailto:hello@cloudposse.com), or join our [`#community`](https://cloudposse.com/slack/) channel.

In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

<Steps>
  1. Fork the repo on GitHub
  2. Clone the project to your own machine
  3. Commit changes to your own branch
  4. Push your work back up to your fork
  5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
</Steps>

<Note>Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!</Note>

## Maintenance

Cloud Posse actively maintains all projects on [our GitHub](https://github.com/cloudposse/).

## Deprecation and Archival Process

From time to time, we may need to deprecate and archive repositories that are no longer actively maintained. We follow a structured process to ensure transparency and give the community adequate notice.

### Step 1: Announce Deprecation via Pull Request

Create a pull request to communicate the planned deprecation. This PR should:
- Clearly state the reason for deprecation
- Specify the planned deprecation date
- Provide migration guidance or alternative solutions (if applicable)
- Tag relevant stakeholders for visibility

### Step 2: Add Deprecation Notice to README

Add a deprecation warning at the top of the `README.md` using a GitHub-style warning admonition:

```markdown
> [!WARNING]
> **Deprecated**: This repository is deprecated and will be archived on [DATE].
> Please see [Issue #XXX](link-to-pinned-issue) for more information.
```

### Step 3: Update README.yaml

If the project uses `README.yaml` for generating documentation, add the `deprecated` field:

```yaml
deprecated:
  notice: |-
    This module is deprecated and will be archived on [DATE].
    Please see the [pinned issue](link-to-pinned-issue) for details and migration guidance.

    Consider using [alternative-module](link) as a replacement.
```

After updating `README.yaml`, regenerate the `README.md`:

```bash
atmos docs generate readme
```

### Step 4: Create and Pin a GitHub Issue

Create a comprehensive GitHub issue that includes:
- Detailed explanation of the deprecation
- Timeline and key dates
- Migration path or alternatives
- Answers to common questions
- Contact information for support

Pin this issue to the repository so it appears at the top of the Issues tab.

### Step 5: Link the Issue in the Deprecation Notice

Update the deprecation notice in the README to link to the pinned issue created in Step 4.

### Step 6: Wait Until Deprecation Date

Allow sufficient time (typically 90+ days) for the community to:
- Migrate away from the deprecated component
- Ask questions and get support
- Complete any in-flight work

### Step 7: Archive the Repository

Once the deprecation date has passed:

1. Update the `.github/settings.yml` file in the repository:

```yaml
repository:
  archived: true
```

2. Commit and merge this change

3. The repository will be automatically archived by GitHub settings automation

Once archived, the repository becomes read-only but remains publicly accessible for historical reference.

## GitHub Projects

There's a lot going on in our GitHub. With over [200+ Open Source repositories](https://github.com/cloudposse/), keeping track of all the [Open Issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acloudposse+type%3Aissues+is%3Aopen), Feature Requests, and Pull Requests is a fulltime job.

We use Kanban board to manage our [Open Source projects](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/projects/3).
