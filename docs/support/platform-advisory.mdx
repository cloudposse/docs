## Why Cloud Posse?

Our team has helped hundreds of companies implement AWS services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, to deploy and manage AWS services such as Amazon EKS, AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Security Hub, and multi-account Organizations.

We’ve built more **Terraform modules for AWS** than anyone else—[160+ and counting](https://github.com/cloudposse/). If it’s AWS and Terraform, we’ve probably already solved it.

When leadership is watching, deadlines are looming, and your team can’t afford to get stuck—**Platform Advisory** is the safety net that helps your platform teams deliver under pressure.
