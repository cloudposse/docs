<Intro>
  There are many ways to get support from AWS, but navigating their organization can be daunting. Understanding these various roles can help you effectively navigate the AWS structure and get the most out of your relationship with AWS.

<Note>
  AWS will not be able to provide support for the Cloud Posse reference architecture. If you have any questions or need support, please reach out to Cloud Posse directly.

### Account Manager

The Account Manager is part of the AWS Sales group and their main focus is on increasing your AWS consumption, but in a good way! üôÇ  Account Managers are very interested in seeing happy AWS customers and knowing at a high level as much as possible about what you want to achieve by running on AWS. Then they lookout for how they can help out on their end. Account Managers will work with APN Partners like Cloud Posse to achieve customer business objectives.

If you need an introduction to your AWS Account Manager, Cloud Posse can assist you with that.

### AWS Technical Account Managers (TAM)

AWS Enterprise Support provides you with a concierge-like service with a dedicated TAM who will maintain context about what your organization is trying to achieve and look out for your best interests navigating the organization. A TAM will be able to connect you with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) throughout the organization. For example, if you have some highly specialized questions on an AWS product, they can bring in an SME to address those questions.

If you need an introduction to your AWS Technical Account Manager, Cloud Posse can assist you with that.

While we‚Äôve never had a customer replace their TAM, in the event you are ever unhappy with your TAM, Cloud Posse can reach out discretely using AWS back channels via our AWS partner status. Our partner can then bypass the TAM and raise any issues or concerns directly with the TAM‚Äôs manager. Of course, this is the last resort, and we hope to resolve any issues by working with the TAM.

### AWS Solutions Architects (SA)

AWS assigns every account a Solutions Architect. Depending on your support agreement with AWS, the SA may even be able to join our regular Design Decision calls. Typically, we see this more often with our customers who have an Enterprise Support agreement. Looping in an SA is a great way to keep AWS informed on your technology roadmap. The SAs frequently bring deep industry knowledge of what other companies in your technology sector are doing (E.g. Healthcare or Financial Services), which is helpful for validation.

### Product Teams (aka ‚ÄúService Teams‚Äù)

AWS has countless services and each one is managed by a Product Team. As necessary, as your AWS Partner we can reach out to teams so that you can learn about upcoming features, make feature requests, and even participate in betas of early features. Customers under an NDA with AWS will also be able to learn about upcoming features not yet announced. This can save your company the cost of implementing workarounds for features that are already planned to be released.
