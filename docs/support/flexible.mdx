<Intro>
Need help with bigger problems? Flexible Support is the most cost-effective way to get expert guidance from [Cloud Posse](https://cloudposse.com) for hands-on help and non-urgent but important requests—like bug fixes, PR reviews, and custom development. Support is scheduled to fit into your timeline, so you get the predictable help you need. Unlike [Essential Support](/support/essential), Flexible Support includes direct engineering work by Cloud Posse, so you can stay focused while we handle the heavy lifting.

## Why Cloud Posse?

Our team has helped hundreds of companies implement AWS services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, to deploy and manage AWS services such as Amazon EKS, AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Security Hub, and Multi-account Organizations. Whether you need PR reviews, bug fixes, custom Terraform module development, or assistance optimizing your AWS architecture, we provide structured, scheduled support to help you achieve your goals.

We’ve built more **Terraform modules for AWS** than anyone else—[160+ and counting](https://github.com/cloudposse/).  If it’s AWS and Terraform, we’ve probably already solved it.
