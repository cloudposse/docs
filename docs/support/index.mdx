<Intro>
  Many teams waste weeks trying to figure things out themselves—time that could have been spent shipping features and scaling their business. If you want clear answers, expert guidance, and hands-on support, our support helps you move faster.  We provide a variety of support options to help you get the most out of our Reference Architecture.
</Intro>

Mix and match our support options to fit your needs and budget. We accept payment via [AWS IQ](https://cloudposse.com/awsiq), [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=81c20b9c-5946-4909-8079-ff84dbb840ee), and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/cloudposse).

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="community" label="Community Support (Free)">
    Community Support is best for teams comfortable with public, best-effort assistance through Cloud Posse’s open channels. Engage with the community via **SweetOps Slack**, **Public Office Hours**, and **GitHub Discussions & Issues** related to our open-source projects.

    <FeatureList>
      - **Free, public access to support**—you can access it today!
      - **Engage with the community**—via SweetOps Slack, Public Office Hours, and GitHub Discussions & Issues.
      - **Learn from past discussions**—previously answered questions and solutions are available to browse.
    </FeatureList>

    Unlike paid support plans, Community Support has **no guaranteed response times or confidentiality**. While Cloud Posse may participate in discussions, responses are at our discretion and subject to availability.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="essential" label="Essential Support" default>
    Essential Support is designed for self-sufficient teams that thrive with expert guidance but don’t require direct, hands-on engagement from Cloud Posse. Unlike free community support—where responses are best-effort—Essential Support guarantees priority responses in GitHub Discussions and gives you exclusive access to weekly private Customer Workshops, so you always have a direct line to Cloud Posse’s expertise.

    <FeatureList>
      - **Priority support in GitHub Discussions**
      - **2x Weekly Customer Workshops via Zoom**
    </FeatureList>

  <TabItem value="flexible" label="Flexible Support">
    Flexible Support is the most cost-effective way to get expert guidance and hands-on help for non-urgent but important requests—like bug fixes, PR reviews, and custom development. Support is scheduled to fit into your timeline, so you get the predictable help you need. Unlike Essential Support, Flexible Support includes direct engineering work by Cloud Posse, so you can stay focused while we handle the heavy lifting.

    <FeatureList>
      - **Scheduled Support** for Calls, PR reviews, bug fixes, and custom development
      - **Private Slack Channel** to collaborate on active requests and schedule new work
    </FeatureList>
    <PrimaryCTA to="/support/flexible">Learn More</PrimaryCTA>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="priority" label="Priority Support">
    Get answers today. Priority Support provides high-touch, same-day assistance for critical issues, production incidents, urgent development, and fast-tracked bug fixes. While our team engages with the community, only Priority Support ensures same-day responses.  Your requests jump to the front of the queue—no delays, no scheduling required. With private Slack channels and direct access to Cloud Posse engineers, you get expert help when and where it matters most.

    <FeatureList>
      - **Direct access to Cloud Posse** via Private Slack Connect channels
      - **No scheduling required**—get support when you need it with same day responses
      - **Priority Handling**—ideal for critical issues, production incidents, and urgent development
