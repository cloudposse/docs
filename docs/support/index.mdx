<Intro>
  Many teams waste weeks trying to figure things out themselves—time that could have been spent shipping features and scaling their business. If you want clear answers, expert guidance, and hands-on support, our support helps you move faster.  We provide a variety of support options to help you get the most out of our Reference Architecture.
</Intro>

Mix and match our support options to fit your team’s needs. Support is available for customers building on Cloud Posse’s reference architecture and open source components. We offer flexible purchasing options to accommodate a variety of procurement processes.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="community" label="Free Tier Support">
    Free Tier Support is available for anyone using Cloud Posse’s **open source projects**. It’s a great way to get **public, best-effort help** from the Cloud Posse team and the broader community.

    You can ask questions and connect through **SweetOps Slack**, **Public Office Hours**, and **GitHub Discussions & Issues**.

    <FeatureList>
      - **Public, best-effort help**—available to all users of our open source projects.

    Just a heads up: Free Tier Support **doesn’t include guaranteed response times or confidentiality**. It’s not intended for support of our commercial reference architectures (Quickstart, Jumpstart) or any paid services. The Cloud Posse team participates when we can—but responses are always best-effort.
