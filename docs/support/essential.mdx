<Intro>
Essential Support is designed for self-sufficient teams that thrive with expert guidance but donâ€™t require direct, hands-on engagement from Cloud Posse. Unlike our free community supportâ€”where responses are best-effortâ€”Essential Support guarantees priority responses in GitHub Discussions and gives you exclusive access to private customer workshops, so you always have a direct line to Cloud Posseâ€™s expertise.
</Intro>

## Why Cloud Posse?

Our team has helped hundreds of companies implement AWS services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, to deploy and manage AWS services such as Amazon EKS, AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Security Hub, and Multi-account Organizations. Whether you need PR reviews, bug fixes, custom Terraform module development, or assistance optimizing your AWS architecture, we provide structured, scheduled support to help you achieve your goals.

Weâ€™ve built more **Terraform modules for AWS** than anyone elseâ€”[160+ and counting](https://github.com/cloudposse/).  If itâ€™s AWS and Terraform, weâ€™ve probably already solved it.

**Need help?** Weâ€™ve got you covered.

## Restrictions

To ensure the highest level of service, we exclusively support customers using [Atmos](https://atmos.tools), our [AWS Reference Architecture](https://docs.cloudposse.com), and our [Terraform modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/modules/) or [components for AWS](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/). This focus allows us to provide expert guidance, maintain best practices, and deliver predictable outcomes tailored to AWS environments.
