<Intro>
Essential Support is designed for self-sufficient teams that thrive with expert guidance but don’t require direct, hands-on engagement from Cloud Posse. Unlike our [free community support](/community)—where responses are best-effort—Essential Support guarantees priority responses in GitHub Discussions and gives you exclusive access to private customer workshops, so you always have a direct line to Cloud Posse’s expertise.
</Intro>

## What's Included?

Your subscription includes **priority access to Cloud Posse expertise**, providing:

<FeatureList>
  - **[2x Weekly Customer Workshops](https://docs.cloudposse.com/quickstart/support/):**
    Join live group sessions twice a week to get expert guidance, troubleshoot challenges, and refine your architecture.
  - **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/discussions):**
    Get expert responses and leverage our knowledge base for self-service troubleshooting.
</FeatureList>

## How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ##  <StepNumber/> Ask Questions on GitHub Discussions

    We use GitHub Discussions to answer questions and provide support. You can ask questions, share ideas, and get help from the Cloud Posse team and the community.

    As part of the onboarding process, we'll ask for a list of GitHub usernames that should have prioritized access to the public discussions.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Join Weekly Customer Workshops via Zoom

    Any time you need assistance or just curious to learn what other customers are asking, join our weekly Customer Workshops held via Zoom, are a great resource for you and your team. Reach out to us to get on the invite-only list.

    By coming prepared to the Customer Workshops, we can dedicate more time to answering your questions and diving into hands-on exercises, making the most of our time together!

## Why Cloud Posse?

Our team has helped hundreds of companies implement AWS services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, to deploy and manage AWS services such as Amazon EKS, AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Security Hub, and Multi-account Organizations. Whether you need PR reviews, bug fixes, custom Terraform module development, or assistance optimizing your AWS architecture, we provide structured, scheduled support to help you achieve your goals.

We’ve built more **Terraform modules for AWS** than anyone else—[160+ and counting](https://github.com/cloudposse/). If it’s AWS and Terraform, we’ve probably already solved it.

**Need help?** We’ve got you covered.
