<Intro>
Essential Support is designed for self-sufficient teams that thrive with expert guidance but don’t require direct, hands-on engagement from Cloud Posse. Unlike our [free community support](/community)—where responses are best-effort—Essential Support guarantees priority responses in GitHub Discussions and gives you exclusive access to private customer workshops, so you always have a direct line to Cloud Posse’s expertise.
</Intro>

## What's Included?

Your subscription includes **priority access to Cloud Posse expertise**, providing:

<FeatureList>
  - **[2x Weekly Customer Workshops](#-join-weekly-customer-workshops-via-zoom):**
    Join live group sessions twice a week to get expert guidance, troubleshoot challenges, and refine your architecture.
  - **[GitHub Discussions](#-ask-questions-on-github-discussions):**
    Get expert responses and leverage our knowledge base for self-service troubleshooting.
</FeatureList>

:::tip
Need **hands-on** support or direct engineering time? Check out our [**Flexible Support**](/support/flexible) and [**Priority Support**](/support/priority) plans for dedicated, one-on-one assistance—so you can stay focused while we handle the heavy lifting..

## How it Works
We provide two ways to get direct access to Cloud Posse so you can get the help you need in a timely manner. Whether you prefer to ask questions asynchronously or discuss them live, we have options to support you.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ##  <StepNumber/> Ask Questions on GitHub Discussions

    The best way to start is by asking your questions asynchronously via **GitHub Discussions**. This allows us to provide detailed responses, including links to documentation and code examples that you can follow at your own pace.

    GitHub Discussions works best when:
    <FeatureList>
      - You encounter a **specific error** that you can share.
      - You have **questions about configuring components**.
      - You need technical quidance on [**Atmos**](https://atmos.tools), [**Geodesic**](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic), or any of our **GitHub Actions**.
      - You run into **documentation issues**.
      - You need **help troubleshooting** a setup.
    </FeatureList>

    Not only will you receive a response from the Cloud Posse team (typically within a day or by the next business day, as part of our two-day SLA), but your question also becomes part of a **searchable knowledge base**. Chances are, someone has already asked a similar question, and you can quickly find answers by searching past discussions.

    As part of the onboarding process, we'll ask for a list of GitHub usernames that should have **prioritized access** to Cloud Posse expertise in these public discussions.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Join Weekly Customer Workshops via Zoom

    If you find it difficult to articulate your question in writing, need real-time guidance, or have a more nuanced issue, our **Weekly Customer Workshops** are a great way to get help.

    These live Zoom sessions provide an interactive space where we can:
    <FeatureList>
      - Workshop your challenges together
      - Answer complex, high-level architectural questions
      - Jump into breakout rooms for **pair programming** and troubleshooting
      - Discuss edge cases that are hard to explain in text
    </FeatureList>

    While these workshops are **invite-only and exclusive to customers**, please note that they are not strictly confidential. If your question involves sensitive or proprietary details, we recommend using our[**Flexible Support**](/support/flexible) or [**Priority Support**](/support/priority) options instead.

    <Note title="Pro Tip">By coming prepared to the Customer Workshops, we can dedicate more time to answering your questions and diving into hands-on exercises, making the most of our time together!</Note>

## Why Cloud Posse?

Our team has helped hundreds of companies implement AWS services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, to deploy and manage AWS services such as Amazon EKS, AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Security Hub, and Multi-account Organizations. Whether you need PR reviews, bug fixes, custom Terraform module development, or assistance optimizing your AWS architecture, we provide structured, scheduled support to help you achieve your goals.

We’ve built more **Terraform modules for AWS** than anyone else—[160+ and counting](https://github.com/cloudposse/). If it’s AWS and Terraform, we’ve probably already solved it.

**Need help?** We’ve got you covered.
