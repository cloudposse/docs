## Paid Support

All customers have direct access to our team via Slack, Zoom, and Email. If you‚Äôre having trouble getting the help you need, you can always reach out to Cloud Posse PMs who will direct you to the right person.

1. Use the private shared Slack channels between Cloud Posse and your company to ask our team questions directly. See [How to Provision Shared Slack Channels](/reference-architecture/how-to-guides/integrations/how-to-provision-shared-slack-channels) to set up additional channels with our team.

2. **Ask questions during calls.** Ask Cloud Posse PMs to add your question to the agenda.

3. Join the [Shared Customer Workshops](/reference-architecture/fundamentals/kick-off/#shared-customer-workshop) and ask the team questions. Customer Workshops are only available to current and previous customers and are held twice a week. Please reach out to Cloud Posse PMs if you need to be added to the recurring events.

### General Etiquette

- Please ask questions in your team's Cloud Posse channel, for example: `#acme-general`. Keep in mind the name you see for your channel might differ from what we see, depending on how your organization has named it.

- Avoid direct messages (DMs) to engineers and keep all discussions in public channels. This approach is crucial for ensuring high-quality service and business continuity. It also helps us manage our engineers' workloads effectively and ensures the right Subject Matter Experts handle specific queries.

- We suggest tagging specific individuals as part of requests. If you‚Äôre unsure who you should ask, you can tag Cloud Posse PMs.

- Use threads a much as possible so we can consolidate conversations and reduce the noise in Slack channels

- For time-sensitive requests, make sure to call that out

- Don‚Äôt worry about when you ask questions or tagging people in questions ‚Äúafter hours‚Äù

- You can bump threads if there‚Äôs no response. Also, we suggest using the emojis above to open tickets

- Don‚Äôt hesitate about opening issues using emojis. It helps us find and stay on top of requests.
