<Intro>
The kickoff process for Jumpstart engagements with Cloud Posse ensures a smooth start with clear communication for a successful project delivery. During the call, we will confirm contract requirements and set project expectations. We also cover how Cloud Posse will deploy your infrastructure in layers using our reference architecture and introduce various support options, including Slack channels, customer workshops, and office hours.

## Kickoff Meeting Agenda

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Introductions

    Here we will review who is on the call, what their roles are, and identify our technical point of contact at Cloud Posse. We will also review the working timezones of the teams.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Project Overview

    Cloud Posse will begin deploying your infrastructure following the [Reference Architecture](/reference-architecture/) and your team's design decisions. The Reference Architecture is a collection of best practices for building a secure, scalable, and highly available infrastructure on AWS. The Reference Architecture is a living document that is constantly evolving as we learn from our customers and the community.

    We will deploy your infrastructure in _layers_. These layers are designed to manage collections of deliverables and will be a mix of generated content from a private reference, vendored Terraform from open source libraries, and any customization for your Organization. Because we are delivering an entire infrastructure repository, these initial PRs will be massive; a complete infrastructure set up requires dozens of components, each with Terraform modules, configuration, account setup, and documentation. You are absolutely welcome to follow along, but we do not intend for your team to be required to review these massive PRs. Cloud Posse internally reviews these PRs extensively to ensure that the final product works as intended.

    Once we're confident that we've deployed a given layer entirely, we then schedule the [Hand-Off Calls](#handoff-calls). A handoff call is intended to explain a given topic and provide the opportunity for your team to review and provide feedback on any given layer, as well as answer other questions. Before each Hand-Off Call we will have a [Fundamental Six Pager](/reference-architecture/category/fundamentals/) that goes into detail on the subject, but we can use the handoff calls however best suites your team. These calls can be a lecture of the material from the given six pager, a demo from Cloud Posse, or an opportunity practice hands-on labs.

    <Admonition type="tip">
      If you come prepared to a Hand-Off call, we can skip the lecture and spend more time answering questions or working through hands-on labs.
    </Admonition>

## How to Succeed

Cloud Posse has noticed several patterns that lead to successful projects.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Come Prepared

    Review six pagers and documentation before Hand-Off calls. This will help you to know what questions need to be asked. Coming unprepared will lead to a lot of questions and back-and-forth. This will slow down material resulting in less time for new material.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Take Initiative

    The most successful customers take initiative to make customizations to their Reference Architecture. This is a great way to make the Reference Architecture your own. It also helps to build a deeper understanding of the Reference Architecture and how it works.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Cameras On

    We recommend that all participants have their cameras on. This helps to build trust and rapport. It also helps to keep everyone engaged and focused. This also lets us gage how everyone is understanding the material. If you are having trouble understanding something, please ask questions.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### <StepNumber/> Ask Questions

    We encourage you to ask questions. We want to make sure that everyone understands the material. We also want to make sure that we are providing the right level of detail. Our meetings are intended to be interactive and encourage conversation. Please feel free to interject at any time if you have a question or a comment to add to the discussion.
  </Step>
</Steps>
