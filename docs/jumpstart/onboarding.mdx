After ensuring you’ve satisfied all the prerequisites, we recommend doing the following

<TaskList>
- [ ] Join the Shared “Slack connect” channels with our team. These are usually named something like `#cloudposse-` on
      the customer’s side.
- [ ] Ensure you’ve been added to any calls with the Cloud Posse team. Depending on the type of engagement, you may have
      weekly cadance calls (Enterprise only) or weekly Customer Workshops (all customers). Cloud Posse PMs can help add
      members to the calendar event.
- [ ] Ensure you’ve been added to the <i>Cloud Posse Linear Project</i> for your company’s engagement with our team.
      Cloud Posse PMs can help add members. **Only applicable for Enterprise engagements**.
- [ ] Learn more about Cloud Posse because as a [DevOps Accelerator](https://cloudposse.com) we are very different from
      typical professional services companies.
- [ ] Review the different ways you can get [Support](/support).
