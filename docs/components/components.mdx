## Terraform Component GitHub Repository Has Moved!

The GitHub repository for Cloud Posse's Terraform components has migrated to a [dedicated GitHub organization](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components). All documentation remains here, but all future updates, contributions, and issue tracking for the source code should now be directed to the respective repositories in the new organization.

[Learn more](/learn/maintenance/tutorials/how-to-update-components-yaml-to-new-organization/) about updating your references to point to the new repositories.
