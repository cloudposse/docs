# Decide on Status Page Requirements

## Problem
The business may be obligated or want to communicate transparently to customers the availability of all services affecting the platforms/products stability.

## Solution
Use [StatusPage.io](http://StatusPage.io) by Atlassian to integrate with OpsGenie and other dependent services to communicate overall availability.

## Other Considerations
- Should it be **Public** (customer-facing) or **Private** (internal facing only)?

- How to host it?

- What to expose to customers?

- Should it pull in the availability of third-party dependencies? e.g. Twillio API
