### Generating a Cluster’s `kubeconfig`
Once Lens is downloaded, it needs a `kubeconfig` file to authenticate with a server. Using a Geodesic shell, run `set-cluster [cluster-name]` to generate a `kubeconfig` in `/conf/.kube`. The file will be named after the cluster and current user’s role; e.g. `set-cluster platform-use2-dev` will generate a file named like `/conf/.kube/kubecfg.platform-use2-dev-admin`.

The easiest way to access this cluster from Lens is to copy the `kubeconfig` to the current system user's `~/.kubeconfig` folder which is represented as `/localhost/.kubeconfig` inside of the Geodesic shell.

#### Example

```
set-cluster platform-use2-dev
cp /conf/.kube/kubecfg.platform-use2-dev-admin /localhost/.kubeconfig/
```

:::note
The filename does not include specific context to the project. They can be renamed on the local user’s system as needed, if naming conflicts arise.

Example:

`mv /localhost/.kubeconfig/kubecfg.platform-use2-dev-admin localhost/.kubeconfig/kubecfg.namespace-platform-use2-dev-admin` where `namespace` is a relevant, distinguishable attribute for that config.

:::

### Importing `kubeconfig`
On the Catalog view, click the `+` in the bottom corner and select the config file imported in the previous step.

The configs can also be synced by hovering over the `+` button and clicking “Sync kubeconfig(s)” button.
