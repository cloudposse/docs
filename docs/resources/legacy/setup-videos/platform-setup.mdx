<Intro>
These videos cover the platform elements of the Cloud Posse Reference Architecture,
including software delivery, GitOps automation, container orchestration, and monitoring.
</Intro>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Software Delivery / Release Engineering

    Learn about Cloud Posse's approach to CI/CD and release engineering. This covers the
    philosophy behind treating pipelines as software, using GitHub Actions for automation,
    and implementing consistent deployment patterns across environments.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> ECS Platform

    Learn about Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) as a container orchestration solution.
    This covers the benefits of ECS over Kubernetes for simpler deployments, cluster configuration,
    service deployment, and integration with the reference architecture.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Monitoring and SRE

    Understand Cloud Posse's approach to monitoring and observability. This covers integrating
    with Datadog, setting up monitors, implementing SLIs/SLOs, and building a monitoring-as-code
    approach using Terraform.
