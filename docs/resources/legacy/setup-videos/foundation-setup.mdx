<Intro>
These videos cover the foundational elements of the Cloud Posse Reference Architecture,
including project setup, account management, identity configuration, and network architecture.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Introduction to Toolchain

    Learn about the essential tools Cloud Posse uses to manage infrastructure as code.
    This guide covers the Geodesic Toolbox Container for standardizing development environments,
    the Atmos framework for implementing conventions and workflows, Terraform for managing
    cloud infrastructure, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Account Management

    Review how Cloud Posse designs and manages AWS Account architectures using Atmos and Terraform,
    aligning with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This covers provisioning the Terraform state
    backend, organizing accounts into Organizational Units (OUs), applying Service Control Policies
    (SCPs), and configuring account-level settings.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Identity and Authentication

    Learn how Cloud Posse sets up fine-grained access control for an entire organization using
    Permission Sets, IAM roles, and AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO). This addresses the challenges
    of managing access across multiple AWS accounts with a solution that ensures precise control,
    easy role switching, and compatibility with different identity providers.

  <Step>
    ## <StepNumber/> Network and DNS

    Understand Cloud Posse's approach to designing robust and scalable Network and DNS architectures
    on AWS, with a focus on symmetry, account-level isolation, security, and reusability. Covers
    account isolation, connecting multiple accounts using Transit Gateways, deploying AWS Client VPN
    for remote network access, and differentiating between DNS service discovery and branded vanity domains.
