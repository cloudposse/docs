# Architectural Design Records (ADRs)
These are the records for why Cloud Posse made various decisions in the design of the Reference Architecture. These decisions may differ from what your organization has decided as a result of going through the [Design Decisions](/reference-architecture/design-decisions) process.

Send requests for additional documentation in the `#refarch-docs` channel.
