:::info Needs Update!

The content in this ADR may be out-of-date and needing an update. For questions, please reach out to Cloud Posse

- The proposal has been already been adopted, and this ADR needs to be updated to reflect the final decision. Cloud Posse recommends use of Workflows generally with [Atmos Workflows](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/workflows/) and specifically with [Reference Architecture](/reference-architecture/setup/workflows/).

:::

## Status
**DRAFT**

## Problem
In the original `variant` version of `atmos` we had the concept of workflows. These were a simple set of steps that could be executed in order to bring up an environment or execute some kind of operation. When we ported `atmos` to Golang, we didn’t carry over this functionality because it was seldom used as implemented. Updating a workflow with all the steps was cumbersome. If a workflow failed, there was no way to restart back at the last failed step. To define a workflow to build and destroy an environment, would require defining two workflows (E.g. `create-env` and `destroy-env`).

## Context

## Considered Alternatives

- Use `make` (or other task runner) to call `atmos`

- Use shell scripts

## Other examples

- See `astro` by Uber (abandoned) [https://github.com/uber/astro](https://github.com/uber/astro)

- Atlantis workflows: [https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/custom-workflows.html#use-cases](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/custom-workflows.html#use-cases)

- Terragrunt dependencies [https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/)

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Maintain the exact same interface

```
import: []
vars: {}

terraform:
  vars: {}

helmfile:
  vars: {}

components:
  terraform:
    fetch-location:
      vars: {}

    fetch-weather:
      vars: {}

    output-results:
      vars: {}
        print_users_weather_enabled: true

  helmfile: {}

workflows:
  deploy-all:
    description: Deploy terraform projects in order
    steps:
      - job: terraform deploy fetch-location
      - job: terraform deploy fetch-weather
      - job: terraform deploy output-results
```

### Option 2: Workflows with parameters

```
import: []
vars: {}

terraform:
  vars: {}

helmfile:
  vars: {}

components:
  terraform:
    fetch-location:
      vars: {}

    fetch-weather:
      vars: {}

    output-results:
      vars: {}
        print_users_weather_enabled: true

  helmfile: {}

workflows:
  deploy-all:
    description: Deploy terraform projects in order
    steps:
      - subcommand: terraform apply fetch-location
        vars:
          enabled: true
      - subcommand: terraform apply fetch-weather
      - subcommand: terraform apply output-results

  destroy-all:
    description: Destroy terraform projects in order
    steps:
      - subcommand: terraform apply output-results
        vars:
          enabled: false
      - subcommand: terraform apply fetch-weather
        vars:
          enabled: false
      - subcommand: terraform apply fetch-location
        vars:
          enabled: false

```

### Option 3: Support native dependencies between components and a `--reverse` flag

First, we add an an official `depends-on` field to our stack configuration.

In this configuration `echo` → `vpc` → `eks` → `external-dns` → `cert-manager`

```
components:
  terraform:
    echo:
      metadata:
        type: abstract
      hooks:
        before:
        - echo "Hello world!"

    vpc:
      component: vpc
      depends-on: echo

    eks:
      component: eks
      depends-on: vpc

    external-dns:
      depends-on: eks
      hooks:
        before-deploy:
        - sleep 100

    cert-manager:
      depends-on: external-dns

    alb-controller:
      depends-on: eks
```

Provision the eks component’s workflow (and everything that depends on `eks`)

```
atmos workflow terraform apply eks
```

Decommission the eks component

```
atmos workflow terraform apply eks --reverse
```

Provision everything that depends on  `eks` , which will deploy `external-dns` and then `cert-manager`

```
atmos workflow terraform apply --depends-on external-dns
```

### Option 4: Leverage Existing Go-based Task Runner Framework

Use something like `gotask` to add rich support into atmos stack configurations, without reinventing the wheel.

gotask: [https://taskfile.dev/#/](https://taskfile.dev/#/)

variant: [https://github.com/mumoshu/variant](https://github.com/mumoshu/variant)

mage: [https://github.com/magefile/mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage)

```
# Gotask example
tasks:
  deploy-all:
    cmds:
      - echo 'Hello World from Task!'
      - atmos terraform apply eks
      - sleep 100
      - atmos terraform apply external-dns
    silent: true
```
