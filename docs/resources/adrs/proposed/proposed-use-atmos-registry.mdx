:::info Needs Update!

The content in this ADR may be out-of-date and needing an update. For questions, please reach out to Cloud Posse

- Cloud Posse uses the [terraform-aws-components](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components) repository with vendoring similarly to how a registry might behave. For more on vendoring, see [atmos vendor pull](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull).

:::

## Problem
We need a way to centralize cloudposse components for reuse across all customers. We have cloudposse/terraform-aws-components, but we do not use it as a source of truth. As a result, maintaining our vast library of components is challenging.

We need some way to discover components to avoid duplication of effort. Providing a registry is a common characteristic among successful languages or tools (E.g. `python` has PyPi, `perl` has CPAN, `ruby` has RubyFoge, `docker` has DockerHub, `terraform` has the Terraform Registry).

Additionally, we need some way to easily create new components (e.g. from a template).

## Solution

Implemnet a GitHub based “registry” for components, stacks and mixins. Use a generator pattern (e.g. like cookiecuter), but make it natively built-in to atmos. (E.g. see  [https://github.com/tmrts/boilr](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr) for inspiration, but anything we do should be a re-implementation with a very nice UI).

### TODO: inconsistencies

- Mixins (YAML vs Terraform)

- Registry usage (search, generating components)

### TODO: explanations

- why even care about templating?

- why add components to `--stack`

### Use-case #1: Pull down existing components

Imagine the command like this...

```
atmos component generate terraform/aurora-postgres \
    --stack uw2-dev \
    --source cloudposse/terraform-aws-components//modules/aurora-postgres \
    --version 1.2.3
```

1. It will download the component

2. It will prompt the user for any information needed, providing sane defaults. It will save the user’s answers, so subsequent generations persist state.

3. It will add a component configuration to the `uw2-dev` stack if none found

4. User commits to VCS

```
atmos component generate terraform/eks \
  --source cloudposse/terraform-aws-components//modules/eks
  --version 1.2.3

atmos stacks generate stacks/catalog/eks \
  --source cloudposse/terraform-aws-stacks//catalog/eks-pci
  --version 1.2.3
```

### Use-case #2: Initialize a new component from the component template for AWS

This will create a new component from some boilerplate template and add it to the `uw2-dev` stack.

```
atmos component generate terraform/my-new-component \
   --stack uw2-dev \
   --source cloudposse/terraform-aws-component-template

```

### Use-case #3: Mixins

This will create a `context.tf` in the `components/my-new-component`

```
atmos mixins generate components/terraform/my-new-component/context.tf \
   --source cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/mixins/context.tf

```

### Use-case #4: List & Search for Components, Stacks and Mixins.

The `--filter` argument is used to filter the results.

Search for all EKS components.

```
atmos component registry list --filter eks
```

Search for all EKS stacks

```
atmos stack registry list --filter eks
```

Search for all mixins

```
atmos mixin registry list --filter context
```

### Use-case #5: Add registries

```
atmos component registry add cloudposse/terraform-aws-components
```

Add our reference architecture registry

```
atmos stack registry add cloudposse/refarch
```

The `atmos.yml` contains:

```
components:
  terraform:
    registries:
      - cloudposse/terraform-aws-components

stacks:
  registries:
  - cloudposse/refarch
```

### Use-case #5: Configuration

```
import:
- uw2-globals
vars:
  stage: testplatform
terraform:
  vars: {}
helmfile:
  vars:
    account_number: "199589633144"
components:
  terraform:
    # this will download all components into `aws-component/0.141.0`
    # it's abstract because: atmos terraform apply aws-component doesn't make sense
    "cloudposse/terarform-aws-components/0.141.0":
      metadata:
        type: abstract
        source: https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components//modules
        version: 0.141.0

    # this will run aurora-postgres from `aws-component/0.141.0/aurora-postgres`
    aurora-postgres:
      component: "cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/0.141.0/aurora-postgres"
      mixins: # calling this mixins is confusing
      # this will upgrade the context.tf
      - file: context.tf
        source: https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/mixins/context.tf
        version: 1.2.3
      vars:
        # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html
        instance_type: db.r4.large
        cluster_size: 1
        cluster_name: main
        database_name: main


   # this will run aurora-postgres from `aws-component/0.141.0/aurora-postgres`
    eks:
      component: "eks"
      mixins:
      metadata:
        type: real
        source: https://github.com/gruntwork/terraform-aws-components//modules/eks
        version: 1.0
      vars:
        # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html
        instance_type: db.r4.large
        cluster_size: 1
        cluster_name: main
        database_name: main
  helmfile:
    cert-manager:
      metadata:
        type: real
        source: https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles/cert-manager/
        version: 1.0
      vars:
        ..
```

### Use-case #6: easy upgrades

```
atmos component upgrade terraform/aws-component --version latest
```

1. This will update `version: 0.141.0` to the latest (e.g. `0.142.0`)

2. Then pull down the `latest` version of the component (in this case, the entire component library) and write it to `components/terraform/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/0.142.0`

3. User commits to VCS

Optionally, the old version can be purged:

```
atmos component upgrade terraform/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components \
  --version latest \
  --update \     # update any derived component versions to use 0.142.0
  --purge \      # delete previous versions
  --commit       # idea: git commit these changes (what about branch, pr, etc)
```

### Use-case #7: diverge from cloudposse component

```
cp -a components/terraform/cloudposse/terraform-aws-modules/aurora-postgres \
    components/terraform/aurora-postgres
```

### Use-case #8: diff

```
atmos component upgrade  --diff --use-defaults
```

### Use-case #6: refarch

```
atmos generate cloudposse/refarch/multi-account-eks-pci
```

1. pull down the refarch for a multi-account PCI compliance refarch

2. It will prompt the user for all the inputs

3. It will generate all the configs and components

4. User commits to VCS
