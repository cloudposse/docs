## Status
**ACCEPTED**

## Problem
We need a simple way to pass parameters to applications without hardcoding the settings. Multiple approaches exist with tradeoffs.

The 12 Factor pattern recommends using environment variables, but there are security implications everyone needs to be aware of.

## Context

## Considered Options

### **Option 1**: Use Environment Variables

#### Pros

- Portable configuration format supported by every mainstream language

- Easily understood (key/value) pairs

- Easily implemented

- Supported by Kubernetes, Docker, and ECS

- Compatible with SSM (via `chamber` and `external-secrets` operator), ASM (`external-secrets` operator) and HashiCorp Vault (via envconsul)

- The 12 Factor pattern recommends using environment variables [https://12factor.net/](https://12factor.net/)

#### Cons

- Environment variables are exposed via the /proc filesystem. any process on the system can read those settings

- Environment variables are harder to validate (e.g. typo an ENV, you won't get a warning in most applications, especially for optional settings)

- Environment variable sprawl: over time, you may end up with hundreds of ENVs as some of our customers have. they have products that have been around for a decade or longer and gone through generations of engineers

- Environment variables are harder to update. E.g. What updates the environment variables, such as CD?

- If your app still consumes configs, but you are parameterizing it with ENVS, it's tedious to update both the envs and the config file templating every time you add an env

- Environment variables are really only convenient for scalars. Serializing structures in YAML/JSON is ugly

- ECS task definitions are capped at 64K, meaning if you use a lot of ENVs (or long ENVs), you will hit this limit when you least expect it

- Kubernetes ConfigMaps are capped at 1MB, so if using ConfigMaps for ENVs, thereâ€™s still a practical limit.

- Legacy applications frequently do not support environment variables

### **Option 2**: Use Configuration Files

#### Pros

- Compatible with Kubernetes ConfigMaps, making them easy to mount into containers
[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#configmap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#configmap)

- Compatible even with legacy applications that depend on configuration files

- Can use templates to generate configuration files from environment variables (e.g. not mutually exclusive)

- Easily deployed as part of CI/CD workflow

#### Cons

- There are a million configuration file formats, and no standardized way of defining them

- For ephemeral environments, configuration files need to be templatized, adding a layer of complexity

- Configuration files should be encrypted (e.g. see `sops-operator` for kubernetes)

## Decision

**DECIDED**: Use environment variables as standardized means of configuration

## Consequences

- Use `external-secrets` operator with Kubernetes to mount SSM/ASM parameters as environment variables

- Use ECS `envs` to pass environment variables to tasks in the service definition
