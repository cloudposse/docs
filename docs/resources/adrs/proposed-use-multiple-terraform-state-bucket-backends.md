# Proposed: Use Multiple Terraform State Bucket Backends
**Date**: **25 Mar 2022**

:::info Needs Update!

The content in this ADR may be out-of-date and needing an update. For questions, please reach out to Cloud Posse

- The proposal remains in draft and needs context updated.

:::

## Status
**DRAFT**

## Problem
- Terraform state backend has sensitive information e.g. RDS master credentials

- Using multiple state backends would alleviate some of these concerns, but introduce new problems with how to manage access to the bucket as well as how remote-state lookups know where to find the state

## Context

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Use AWS SSO with Standalone IAM Roles

Create a `terraform-prod`  `PermissionSet` and create a `terraform-non-prod` PermissionSet.

#### Pros

#### Cons

- We create permission sets, not roles. We only create permission sets in the `aws-sso`, standalone components cannot create permission sets.

- Introducing more permission sets pollutes the global namespace with roles that are only really relevant in a couple of accounts

- Delegation of PermissionSets cannot be given to other components

### Option 2: Use Federated IAM with SAML

### Option 3:

## Decision
