### What are the included labels?

By default, Cloud Posse includes a few labels for common use-cases. 

#### Pull Request Labels
1. `auto-apply` - If added, the Atmos Terraform Apply workflow will be triggered for all affected components when the Pull Request is merged.
1. `no-plan` - If added, the Atmos Terraform Plan workflow will be skipped on commits to the Pull Request, and the Atmos Apply workflow will be skipped when the Pull Request is merged.

#### Issue Labels
- `apply` - Triggers the Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation workflow for a specific component and stack
- `discarded` - Issue was closed by the drift detection workflow
- `drift` - Indicates that drift was detected by the drift detection workflow
- `drift-recovered` - Indicates that an issue is no longer experiencing drift
- `error` - Indicates an error occurred during planning for a specific component and stack
- `error-recovered` - Indicates that an error state has been resolved
- `remediated` - Issue was successfully remediated by the drift remediation action
- `removed` - Issue is closed because the component no longer exists (code was deleted)

### Enabling or disabling components

Components are included in the Atmos GitHub Action workflows only if they have actions enabled with the `terraform.settings.github.actions_enabled` option.

If they do not have this setting or the value is `false`, the component may still appear in the list of affected components, but Terraform will not be run against the given component and stack.

:::info Global Defaults

Typically Cloud Posse sets the default value to `true` for all components and disables individual components on a case-by-case basis.

For example in an `acme` organization, the default value could be set with `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml`:

```yaml
terraform:
  # These settings are applied to ALL components by default but can be overwritten
  settings:
    github:
      actions_enabled: true
```

And the `account` component could be disabled with `stacks/catalog/account.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    account:
      settings:
        github:
          actions_enabled: false
```

### I cannot assume the `gitops` role from GitHub Workflows

The following error commonly occurs when setting up `gitops` roles and permission:

```
Error: Could not assume role with OIDC: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
```

To resolve this error, thoroughly read through each of the [Authentication Prerequisites](/resources/deprecated/gitops/setup#authentication-prerequisites) for GitOps setup. In particular, check the capitalization of `trusted_github_repos` within `aws-teams` and check the `permissions` for the workflow in GitHub.
