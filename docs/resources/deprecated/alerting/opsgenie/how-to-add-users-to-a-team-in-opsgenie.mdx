<Intro>
Adding users to a team in OpsGenie ensures that the right team members are notified when alerts occur. This guide will help you update your team's YAML stack configuration to include new members, specify their roles, and integrate the changes seamlessly using the `opsgenie-team` component. Whether you're managing a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team or any other team, this process ensures efficient alert handling and response.
</Intro>

## Problem

We often need to change who on a team responds to particular alerts.

### Prerequisites

Assuming you are using the [opsgenie-team](/components/library/aws/opsgenie-team/) component with `ignore_team_members` set to `false`

## Solution

:::tip
**TL;DR**

In your teamâ€™s YAML stack configuration, add users to the `members` array block.

Example Configuration:

```
members:
  - user: erik@cloudposse.com
    role: admin
  - user: ben@cloudposse.com
```

```
components:
  terraform:
    opsgenie-team-sre:
      component: opsgenie-team
      settings:
        spacelift:
          workspace_enabled: true
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: sre
        description: "SRE team"

        members:
          - user: erik@cloudposse.com
            role: admin
          - user: ben@cloudposse.com
```
