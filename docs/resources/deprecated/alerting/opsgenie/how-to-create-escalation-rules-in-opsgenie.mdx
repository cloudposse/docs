<Intro>
Creating escalation rules in OpsGenie allows you to control the actions taken when an alert isn’t acknowledged. This guide will walk you through configuring escalation rules in the stack configuration of the `opsgenie-team` component, ensuring timely response and proper alert handling. By defining escalation conditions and actions, you can efficiently manage alert escalations within your teams.

## Problem

You want to control what to do when an alert isn’t acknowledged.

## Solution

:::tip
**TL;DR** This is controlled by escalation rules in the stack configuration of the `opsgenie-team`.
:::

An Escalation resource for a team is directly exposed via a map. Have a look at [escalations in terraform for exact variable names](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/opsgenie/opsgenie/latest/docs/reference/escalation)  and [How do escalations work in opsgenie](https://support.atlassian.com/opsgenie/docs/how-do-escalations-work-in-opsgenie/) to determine how you want to configure your escalations.

An example is below

```
components:
  terraform:
    opsgenie-team-my-team:
      component: opsgenie-team
      ...
        escalations:
          my-team_escalate_to_sre:
            enabled: true
            description: "Escalate to 'sre' team if 'my-team' team does not acknowledge"
            rule:
              condition: if-not-acked
              notify_type: all
              delay: 5
              recipients:
                - type: team
                  team_name: sre
            repeat:
              wait_interval: 10
              count: 2
              reset_recipient_states: false
              close_alert_after_all: false
```
