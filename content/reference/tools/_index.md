Our toolchain consists of dozen's of Open Source tools. We distribute many of them as part of [geodeisc](/geodesic/), but make all of them available via our [`packages`](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages) repo.

# Packages

"Packages" is the Cloud Posse installer and distribution of native apps. Use this repo to easily install binary releases of popular apps for cloud automation (e.g. `chamber`, `kops`, `aws-vault`, etc). This is useful for inclusion into a Dockerfile to install dependencies.
