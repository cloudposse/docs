This is a collection of best practices, workflows, scripts and scenarios that Cloud Posse uses for load and performance testing of websites and applications
(in particular those deployed on Kubernetes clusters).

__NOTE:__ All load testing scenarios in [scenarios](scenarios) are just examples and are provided here for reference.
Consider updating them to reflect your environment.


For load and performance testing, the workflow consists of these main steps:

1. [Select and configure load testing tools]({{< relref "load-testing/a_select-and-configure-load-testing-tools.md" >}})
2. [Implement load testing scenarios and scripts]({{< relref "load-testing/b_implement-load-testing-scenarios-and-scripts.md" >}})
3. [Perform load testing and analyze the results]({{< relref "load-testing/c_perform-load-testing-and-analyze-the-results.md" >}})
4. [Suggest improvements and tuning procedures for the infrastructure and application under test]({{< relref "load-testing/d_suggest-improvements-and-tuning-procedures.md" >}})
