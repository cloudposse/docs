This is a collection of best practices, workflows, scripts and scenarios that Cloud Posse uses for load and performance testing of websites and applications
(in particular those deployed on Kubernetes clusters).

For load and performance testing, our workflow consists of these main steps:

1. [Load Testing Tools]({{< relref "load-testing/load-testing-tools.md" >}}) - how we select and setup our load testing tools
2. [Load Testing Scenarios]({{< relref "load-testing/load-testing-scenarios.md" >}}) - how we implement load testing scenarios
3. [Perform Testing and Analyze Results]({{< relref "load-testing/perform-testing-and-analyze-results.md" >}}) - how we do load testing and analyze the results
4. [Optimization and Tuning Procedures]({{< relref "load-testing/optimization-and-tuning-procedures.md" >}}) - optimization and tuning steps that we usually perform after running load tests
