## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made across our projects for greater transparency and better record keeping. 

Part of the problem is sometimes decisions made today, lack context months or years from now. 

Othertimes, we forget why a particular decision was made when seemingly better alternatives exist. 

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by [Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). 

## Consequences

We are going to start by documenting some of our decisions [here](https://github.com/cloudposse/docs), rougly following the process used by [`adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools). 

These will be decisions that affect our overall strategy, rather than decisions that relate to one particular repository or project.
