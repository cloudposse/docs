We're developers and ops practitioners who are gungho about doing things the "right way" (tm).

We help companies achieve success in the cloud by automating systems for maximum efficiency and 24x7 uptime. Our solutions deliver world-class infrastructure by leveraging Open Source technologies coupled with proprietary integrations to reduce total cost of ownership. Following our proven methodology empowers companies to adopt the most current "best practices" including end-to-end CI/CD Pipelines, GitOps and Automated Deployments. The results are human-centric systems that are easier to maintain and thus reduce technical debt. By prioritization of automation, the Cloud Posse approach improves developer productivity and increases overall platform stability.
