description: "[Amazon CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you donâ€™t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers."

CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue. Because CodeBuild runs in AWS, it can leverage IAM Instance Profiles to assume roles to securely provision resources without exposing AWS access credentials.
