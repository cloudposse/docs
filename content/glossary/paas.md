A Platform-as-a-Service is a type of cloud platform which offers black-box services that enable developers to build applications on top of the compute infrastructure without needing to deal with the day-to-day maintenance of the infrastructure. This might include developer tools that are offered as a service to build services, or data access and database services, or billing services.
