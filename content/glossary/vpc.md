A virtual private cloud (“VPC”) is an isolated environment running inside of a public cloud. You can think of it like a private data center with its own private subnets and resources. A VPC can also be an extension of a physical datacenter. The most common example of a VPC is the service that Amazon offers called “Amazon VPC” which allows customers to make Amazon EC2 an extension to their physical infrastructure using an IPsec VPN tunnel.
