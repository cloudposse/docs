Synthetic monitoring is a style of monitoring that attempts to closely emulate the behavior of an end-user, often by using scripted recordings of web transactions played back through a web browser using plugin like Selenium. The scripts carry out behaviors (such as traversing paths) to simulate an action that a customer or end-user would take on a site. E.g. we highly recommend testing all user registration flows and password reset forms using this methodology.
