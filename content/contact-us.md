We're developers and ops practitioners who are gung-ho about doing things the "right way" (tm).

We help companies achieve success in the cloud by automating systems for maximum efficiency and 24x7 uptime. Our solutions deliver world-class infrastructure by leveraging [Open Source technologies](/reference/tools.mdx) coupled with proprietary integrations to reduce total cost of ownership. Following our [proven methodology](/intro.md) empowers companies to adopt the most current "best practices" including end-to-end CI/CD Pipelines, GitOps and Automated Deployments. The results are human-centric systems that are easier to maintain and thus reduce technical debt. By prioritization of automation, the Cloud Posse approach improves developer productivity and increases overall platform stability.
