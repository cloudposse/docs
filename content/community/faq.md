## How do I see all open Pull Requests?

You can find all open Pull Requests by going to [GitHub and searching for open PRs](https://github.com/pulls?q=is:pr+is:open+org:cloudposse).

## What if we approve and merge a Pull Request with a problem?

We encourage everyone who uses our modules to practice version pinning. So while we try to ensure `master` is always stable, 
we're not concerned if we occasionally break things. Also, we believe in a blameless culture. We rather figure out and fix
why something happened than blame or chastise our volunteers.

## What are your best-practices we should follow?

 See our  [Terraform Best Practices]({{< relref "terraform/best-practices.md" >}}) and [Development Best Practices]({{< relref "development/best-practices.md" >}}). These are just some guidelines to follow and we're open to your feedback!

## What benefits do I receive as a contributor?

As a contributor, you'll be able to expedite the reviews of Pull Requests for your organization by having a direct
line of communication with our community of volunteers.

## Are contributors paid?

All of our contributors are volunteers. Granted, some of our "volunteers" happen to work for Cloud Posse. They get paid! =)

## How do contributors collaborate?

Contributors participate in a private Slack channel on the [SweetOps Slack team](https://slack.sweetops.com/) and via GitHub on issues and pull requests.
