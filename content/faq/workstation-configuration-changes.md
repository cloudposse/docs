## Question

What changes should we expect to make to engineers' workstation configurations to be able to interface with this new environment from the start?


## Answer

Basically, they should have Docker. Thatâ€™s it.

If we were aiding with local `dev` environments, we'd also say `chamber` and `aws-vault`.
