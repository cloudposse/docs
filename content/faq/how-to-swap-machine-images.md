## Question

How can we swap out machine images (e.g. tweak an AMI)?

## Answer

Inside the `kops` manifest,  the base images are parameterized with an environment variable `KOPS_BASE_IMAGE`.

An example is provided [here](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic/blob/master/rootfs/templates/kops/default.yaml#L150).

More information is provided [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/images.md).
