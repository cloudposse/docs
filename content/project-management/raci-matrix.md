The [RACI Responsibility assignment matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) is used to clarify the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables as it relates to projects or teams.

* **Responsible:** Those who perform or recommend the work to achieve the task.
* **Accountable:** The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible. They are required to sign off (approve) work that the Responsible party provides. There must be only one accountable party specified for each Role or Responsibility.
* **Consulted:** Those whose opinions are sought, typically Subject Matter Experts (SME) and with whom there is two-way communication.
* **Informed:** Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication.
