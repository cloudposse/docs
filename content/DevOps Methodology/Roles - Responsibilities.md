The following matrix outlines various components and responsibilities that establishes who amongst the various teams involved are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each action or component. We use the [RACI Matrix](doc:raci-matrix) to assign responsibilities.


# Roles

There are four teams involved in these processes. Team membership is not exclusive. Members may be part of multiple teams.
