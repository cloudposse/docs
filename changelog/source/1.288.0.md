# 1.288.0

<details>
  <summary>Placeholder for `upgrade-guide.md` @milldr (#823)</summary>

### what
- Added a placeholder file for `docs/upgrade-guide.md` with a basic explanation of what is to come

### why
- With #811 we moved the contents of this upgrade-guide file to the individual component. We plan to continue adding upgrade guides for individual components, and in addition, create a higher-level upgrade guide here
- However, the build steps for refarch-scaffold expect `docs/upgrade-guide.md` to exist and are failing without it. We need a placeholder until the `account-map`, etc changes are added to this file

### references
- Example of failing release: https://github.com/cloudposse/refarch-scaffold/actions/runs/5885022872
