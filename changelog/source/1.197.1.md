# 1.197.1

### üêõ Bug Fixes

<details>
  <summary>Remove (broken) root access to EKS clusters @Nuru (#668)</summary>

### what

- Remove (broken) root access to EKS clusters
- Include session name in audit trail of users accessing EKS

### why

- Test code granting access to all `root` users and roles was accidentally left in #645 and breaks when Tenants are part of account names
- There is no reason to allow `root` users to access EKS clusters, so even when this code worked it was wrong
- Audit trail can keep track of who is performing actions
