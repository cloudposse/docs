# 1.203.0

<details>
  <summary>Update `vpc` and `eks/cluster` components @aknysh (#677)</summary>

### what
* Update `vpc` and `eks/cluster` components

### why
* Use latest module versions

* Take into account `var.availability_zones` for the EKS cluster itself. Only the `node-group` module was using `var.availability_zones` to use the subnets from the provided AZs. The EKS cluster (control plane) was using all the subnets provisioned in a VPC. This caused issues because EKS is not available in all AZs in a region, e.g. it's not available in `us-east-1e` b/c of a limited capacity, and when using all AZs from `us-east-1`, the deployment fails

* The latest version of the `vpc` component (which was updated in this PR as well) has the outputs to get a map of AZs to the subnet IDs in each AZ

```
  # Get only the public subnets that correspond to the AZs provided in `var.availability_zones`
  # `az_public_subnets_map` is a map of AZ names to list of public subnet IDs in the AZs
  public_subnet_ids = flatten([for k, v in local.vpc_outputs.az_public_subnets_map : v if contains(var.availability_zones, k)])

  # Get only the private subnets that correspond to the AZs provided in `var.availability_zones`
  # `az_private_subnets_map` is a map of AZ names to list of private subnet IDs in the AZs
  private_subnet_ids = flatten([for k, v in local.vpc_outputs.az_private_subnets_map : v if contains(var.availability_zones, k)])
```
