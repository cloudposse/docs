# 1.198.3

### üêõ Bug Fixes

<details>
  <summary>Correct `cloudtrail` Account-Map Reference @milldr (#673)</summary>

### what
- Correctly pull Audit account from `account-map` for `cloudtrail`
- Remove `SessionName` from EKS RBAC user name wrongly added in #668

### why
- account-map remote state was missing from the `cloudtrail` component
- Account names should be pulled from account-map, not using a variable
- Session Name automatically logged in `user.extra.sessionName.0` starting at Kubernetes 1.20, plus addition had a typo and was only on Teams, not Team Roles
