# 1.284.0

<details>
  <summary>Datadog upgrades @Nuru (#814)</summary>

### what

- Update Datadog components:
   - `eks/datadog-agent` see `eks/datadog-agent/CHANGELOG.md`
   - `datadog-configuration` better handling of `enabled = false`
   - `datadog-integration` move "module count" back to "module" for better compatibility and maintainability, see `datadog-integration/CHANGELOG.md`
   - `datadog-lambda-forwared` fix issues around `enable = false` and incomplete destruction of resources (particularly log groups) see `datadog-lambda-forwarder/CHANGELOG.md`
   - Cleanup `datadog-monitor` see `datadog-monitor/CHANGELOG.md` for details. Possible breaking change in that several inputs have been removed, but they were previously ignored anyway, so no infrastructure change should result from you simply removing any inputs you had for the removed inputs.
   - Update `datadog-sythetics` dependency `remote-state` version
   - `datadog-synthetics-private-location` migrate control of namespace to `helm-release` module. Possible destruction and recreation of component on upgrade. See CHANGELOG.md

### why

- More reliable deployments, especially when destroying or disabling them
- Bug fixes and new features
