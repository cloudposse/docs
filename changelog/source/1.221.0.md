# 1.221.0

<details>
  <summary>feat: New Component `aws-ssosync` @dudymas (#625)</summary>

### what
* adds a fork of [aws-ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) as a lambda on a 15m cronjob

### Why
Google is one of those identity providers that doesn't have good integration with AWS SSO. In order to sync groups and users across we need to use some API calls, luckily AWS Built [aws-ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) to handle that.

Unfortunately, it required ASM so we use [Benbentwo/ssosync](https://github.com/Benbentwo/ssosync) as it removes that requirement.
