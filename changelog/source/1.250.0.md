# 1.250.0

<details>
  <summary>Add EKS addons and the required IRSA to the `eks` component @aknysh (#723)</summary>

### what
* Deprecate the `eks-iam` component
* Add EKS addons and the required IRSA for the addons to the `eks` component
* Add ability to specify configuration values and timeouts for addons
* Add ability to deploy addons to Fargate when necessary
* Add ability to omit specifying Availability Zones and infer them from private subnets
* Add recommended but optional and requiring opt-in: use a single Fargate Pod Execution Role for all Fargate Profiles

### why
* The `eks-iam` component is not in use (we now create the IAM roles for Kubernetes Service Accounts in the https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-helm-release module), and has very old and outdated code

* AWS recommends to provision the required EKS addons and not to rely on the managed addons (some of which are automatically provisioned by EKS on a cluster)

* Some EKS addons (e.g. `vpc-cni` and `aws-ebs-csi-driver`) require an IAM Role for Kubernetes Service Account (IRSA) with specific permissions. Since these addons are critical for cluster functionality, we create the IRSA roles for the addons in the `eks` component and provide the role ARNs to the addons

* Some EKS addons can be configured. In particular, `coredns` requires configuration to enable it to be deployed to Fargate.

* Users relying on Karpenter to deploy all nodes and wanting to deploy `coredns` or `aws-ebs-csi-driver` addons need to deploy them to Fargate or else the EKS deployment will fail.

* Enable DRY specification of Availability Zones, and use of AZ IDs, by reading the VPCs AZs.

* A cluster needs only one Fargate Pod Execution Role, and it was a mistake to provision one for every profile. However, making the change would break existing clusters, so it is optional and requires opt-in.
