# 1.214.0

<details>
  <summary>Transit Gateway `var.connections` Redesign @milldr (#685)</summary>

### what
- Updated how the connection variables for `tgw/hub` and `tgw/spoke` are defined
- Moved the old versions of `tgw` to `deprecated/tgw`

### why
- We want to be able to define multiple or alternately named `vpc` or `eks/cluster` components for both hub and spoke
- The cross-region components are not updated yet with this new design, since the current customers requesting these updates do not need cross-region access at this time. But we want to still support the old design s.t. customers using cross-region components can access the old components. We will need to update the cross-region components with follow up effort
