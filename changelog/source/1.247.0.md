  <summary>Update `waf` and `alb` components @aknysh (#755)</summary>

### what
* Update `waf` component
* Update `alb` component

### why
* For `waf` component, add missing features supported by the following resources:
  - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/wafv2_web_acl 
  -  https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/wafv2_web_acl_logging_configuration

* For `waf` component, remove deprecated features not supported by Terraform `aws` provider v5:
  - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade#resourceaws_wafv2_web_acl
  - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade#resourceaws_wafv2_web_acl_logging_configuration

* For `waf` component, allow specifying a list of Atmos components to read from the remote state and associate their ARNs with the web ACL

* For `alb` component, update the modules to the latest versions and allow specifying Atmos component names for the remote state in the variables (for the cases where the Atmos component names are not standard)
