# 1.131.0

<details>
  <summary>SSO upgrades and Support for Assume Role from Identity Users @johncblandii (#567)</summary>

### what
* Upgraded `aws-sso` to use `0.7.1` modules
* Updated `account-map/modules/roles-to-principals` to support assume role from SSO users in the identity account
* Adjusted `aws-sso/policy-Identity-role-RoleAccess.tf` to use the identity account name vs the stage so it supports names like `core-identity` instead of just `identity`

### why
* `aws-sso` users could not assume role to plan/apply terraform locally
* using `core-identity` as a name broke the `aws-sso` policy since account `identity` does not exist in `full_account_map`
