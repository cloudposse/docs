# 1.209.0

<details>
  <summary>Update ALB controller IAM policy @Nuru (#696)</summary>

### what

* Update `eks/alb-controller` controller IAM policy


### why

* Email from AWS: 
> On June 1, 2023, we will be adding an additional layer of security to ELB â€˜Create*' API calls where API callers must have explicit access to add tags in their Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. Currently, access to attach tags was implicitly granted with access to 'Create*' APIs.

### references
* [Updated IAM policy](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/pull/3068)
