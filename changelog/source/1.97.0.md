  <summary>Upstream EKS Action Runner Controller @milldr (#528)</summary>

### what
- Upstreaming the latest additions for the EKS actions runner controller component

### why
- We've added additional features for the ARC runners, primarily adding options for ephemeral storage and persistent storage. Persistent storage can be used to add image caching with EFS
- Allow for setting a `webhook_startup_timeout` value different than `scale_down_delay_seconds`. Defaults to `scale_down_delay_seconds`
