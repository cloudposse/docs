  <summary>[eks/cluster] Add support for BottleRocket and EFS add-on @Nuru (#795)</summary>

### what

- Add support for EKS EFS add-on
- Better support for Managed Node Group's Block Device Storage
- Deprecate and ignore `aws_teams_rbac` and remove `identity` roles from `aws-auth`
- Support `eks/cluster` provisioning EC2 Instance Profile for Karpenter nodes (disabled by default via legacy flags)
- More options for specifying Availability Zones 
- Deprecate `eks/ebs-controller` and `eks/efs-controller`
- Deprecate `eks/eks-without-spotinst`

### why

- Support EKS add-ons, follow-up to #723 
- Support BottleRocket, `gp3` storage, and provisioned iops and throughput
- Feature never worked
- Avoid specific failure mode when deleting and recreating an EKS cluster
- Maintain feature parity with `vpc` component
- Replace with add-ons

  <summary>[eks/storage-class] Initial implementation @Nuru (#794)</summary>

### what

- Initial implementation of `eks/storage-class`

### why

- Until now, we provisioned StorageClasses as a part of deploying [eks/ebs-controller](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/ba309ab4ffa96169b2b8dadce0643d13c1bd3ae9/modules/eks/ebs-controller/main.tf#L20-L56) and [eks/efs-controller](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/ba309ab4ffa96169b2b8dadce0643d13c1bd3ae9/modules/eks/efs-controller/main.tf#L48-L60). However, with the switch from deploying "self-managed" controllers to EKS add-ons, we no longer deploy `eks/ebs-controller` or `eks/efs-controller`. Therefore, we need a new component to manage StorageClasses independently of controllers.

  <summary>[eks/karpenter] Script to update Karpenter CRDs @Nuru (#793)</summary>

### what

- [eks/karpenter] Script to update Karpenter CRDs

### why

- Upgrading Karpenter to v0.28.0 requires updating CRDs, which is not handled by current Helm chart. This script updates them by modifying the existing CRDs to be labeled as being managed by Helm, then installing the `karpenter-crd` Helm chart.
