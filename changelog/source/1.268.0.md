# 1.268.0

  <summary>Added new variable into `argocd-repo` component to configure ArgoCD's `ignore-differences` @zdmytriv (#785)</summary>

### what
* Added new variable into `argocd-repo` component to configure ArcoCD `ignore-differences`

### why
* There are cases when application and/or third-party operators might want to change k8s API objects. For example, change the number of replicas in deployment. This will conflict with ArgoCD application because the ArgoCD controller will spot drift and will try to make an application in sync with the codebase.

### references
* https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#respect-ignore-difference-configs
