<details>
  <summary>Karpenter bugfix, EKS add-ons to mangaed node group @Nuru (#816)</summary>

### what

- [eks/karpenter] use Instance Profile name from EKS output
- Clarify recommendation and fix defaults regarding deploying add-ons to managed node group

### why

- Bug fix: Karpenter did not work when legacy mode disabled
- Originally we expected to use Karpenter-only clusters and the documentation and defaults aligned with this. Now we recommend all Add-Ons be deployed to a managed node group, but the defaults and documentation did not reflect this.
