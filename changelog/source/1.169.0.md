<details>
  <summary>[eks/actions-runner-controller]: support Runner Group, webhook queue size @Nuru (#621)</summary>

### what
- `eks/actions-runner-controller`
   - Support [Runner Groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups)
   - Enable configuration of the webhook queue size limit
   - Change runner controller Docker image designation
- Add documentation on Runner Groups and Autoscaler configuration

### why

- Enable separate access control to self-hosted runners
- For users that launch a large number of jobs in a short period of time, allow bigger queues to avoid losing jobs
- Maintainers recommend new tag format. `ghcr.io` has better rate limits than `docker.io`.
