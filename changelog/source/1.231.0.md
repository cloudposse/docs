  <summary>roll guard duty back to previous providers logic @mcalhoun (#727)</summary>

### what
* Roll the Guard Duty component back to using the previous logic for role assumption.

### why
* The newer method is causing the provider to try to assume the role twice. We get the error:

```
AWS Error: operation error STS: AssumeRole, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000, api error AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::000000000000:assumed-role/acme-core-gbl-security-terraform/aws-go-sdk-1687312396297825294 is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/acme-core-gbl-security-terraform
