  <summary>[lambda] feat: allows to use YAML instead of JSON for IAM policy @gberenice (#692)</summary>

### what
* BREAKING CHANGE: Actually use variable `function_name` to set the lambda function name. 
* Make the variable `function_name` optional. When not set, the old null-lable-derived name will be use.
* Allow IAM policy to be specified in a custom terraform object as an alternative to JSON.

### why
* `function_name` was required to set, but it wasn't actually passed to `module "lambda"` inputs.
* Allow callers to stop providing `function_name` and preserve old behavior of using automatically generated name.
* When using [Atmos](https://atmos.tools/) to generate inputs from "stack" YAML files, having the ability to pass the statements in as a custom object means specifying them via YAML, which makes the policy declaration in stack more readable compared to embedding a JSON string in the YAML.
