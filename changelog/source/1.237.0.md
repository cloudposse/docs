# 1.237.0

<details>
  <summary>Add Missing `github-oidc-provider` Thumbprint @milldr (#736)</summary>

### what
- include both thumbprints for GitHub OIDC

### why
- There are two possible intermediary certificates for the Actions SSL certificate and either can be returned by Github's servers, requiring customers to trust both. This is a known behavior when the intermediary certificates are cross-signed by the CA.
