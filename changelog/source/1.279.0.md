# 1.279.0

<details>
  <summary>fix: restore argocd notification ssm lookups @dudymas (#764)</summary>

### what
* revert some changes to `argocd` component
* connect argocd notifications with ssm secrets
* remove `deployment_id` from `argocd-repo` component
* correct `app_hostname` since gha usually adds protocol

### why
* regressions with argocd notifications caused github actions to timeout
* `deployment_id` no longer needed for fascilitating communication between gha
and ArgoCD
* application urls were incorrect and problematic during troubleshooting
