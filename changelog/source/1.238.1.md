# 1.238.1

### Upgrade notes:

There is a bug in this version of `github-oidc-provider`. Upgrade to version v1.240.1 or later instead.

After installing this version of `github-oidc-provider`, you may need to change the configuration in your stacks.

- If you have dynamic Terraform roles enabled, then this should be configured like a normal component. The previous component may have required you to set 

    ```yaml
    backend:
      s3:
        role_arn: null
    ````
and **that configuration should be removed** everywhere.
- If you only use SuperAdmin to deploy things to the `identity` account, then for the `identity` (and `root`, if applicable) account ***only***, set

    ```yaml
    backend:
      s3:
        role_arn: null
    vars:
      superadmin: true
    ````
**Deployments to other accounts should not have any of those settings**. 

### ðŸš€ Enhancements

<details>
  <summary>[github-oidc-provider] extra-compatible provider @Nuru (#742)</summary>

### what && why

- This updates `provider.tf` to provide compatibility with various legacy configurations as well as the current reference architecture
- This update does NOT require updating `account-map`
