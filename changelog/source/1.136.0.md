# 1.136.0

<details>
  <summary>Set spacelift-worker-pool ami explicitly to x86_64 @arcaven (#577)</summary>

### why
- autoscaling group for spacelift-worker-pool will fail to launch when new arm64 images return first
- arm64 ami image is being returned first at the moment in us-east-1

### what
- set spacelift-worker-pool ami statically to return only x86_64 results

### references
- Spacelift Worker Pool ASG may fail to scale due to ami/instance type mismatch #575
- Note: this is an alternative to spacelift-worker-pool README update and AMI limits #573 which I read after, but I think this     filter approach will be more easily be refactored into setting this as an attribute in variables.tf in the near future
