# 1.250.1

### ðŸš€ Enhancements

<details>
  <summary>[eks/karpenter-provisioner] minor improvements @Nuru (#759)</summary>

### what

- [eks/karpenter-provisioner]:
  - Implement `metadata_options`
  - Avoid Terraform errors by marking Provisoner `spec.requirements` a computed field
  - Add explicit error message about Consolidation and TTL Seconds After Empty being mutually exclusive
  - Add `instance-category` and `instance-generation` to example in README
  - Make many inputs optional
- [eks/karpenter] Update README to indicate that version 0.19 or later of Karpenter is required to work with this code.

### why

- Bug Fix: Input was there, but was being ignored, leading to unexpected behavior 
- If a requirement that had a default value was not supplied, Terraform would fail with an error about inconsistent plans because Karpenter would fill in the default
- Show some default values and how to override them
- Reduce the burden of supplying empty fields
