# 1.220.0

<details>
  <summary>Disable helm experiments by default, block Kubernetes provider 2.21.0 @Nuru (#712)</summary>

### what

* Set `helm_manifest_experiment_enabled` to `false` by default
* Block Kubernetes provider 2.21.0

### why

* The `helm_manifest_experiment_enabled` reliably breaks when a Helm chart installs CRDs. The initial reason for enabling it was for better drift detection, but the provider seems to have fixed most if not all of the drift detection issues since then. 
* Kubernetes provider 2.21.0 had breaking changes which were reverted in 2.21.1.
