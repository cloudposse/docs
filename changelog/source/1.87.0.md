# 1.87.0

<details>
  <summary>Add account-quotas component @Nuru (#515)</summary>

### what

- Add `account-quotas` component to manage account service quota increase requests

### why

- Add service quotas to the infrastructure that can be represented in code

### notes

Cloud Posse has a [service quotas module](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-service-quotas), but it has issues, such as not allowing the service to be specified by name, and not having well documented inputs. It also takes a list input, but Atmos does not merge lists, so a map input is more appropriate. Overall I like this component better, and if others do, too, I will replace the existing module (only at version 0.1.0) with this code.
