<details>
  <summary>Support setting consolidation in karpenter-provisioner @max-lobur (#536)</summary>

### what
This is an alternative way of deprovisioning - proactive one.
```
There is another way to configure Karpenter to deprovision nodes called Consolidation. 
This mode is preferred for workloads such as microservices and is imcompatible with setting 
up the ttlSecondsAfterEmpty . When set in consolidation mode Karpenter works to actively 
reduce cluster cost by identifying when nodes can be removed as their workloads will run 
on other nodes in the cluster and when nodes can be replaced with cheaper variants due 
to a change in the workloads
```

### why
* To let users set a more aggressive deprovisioning strategy
