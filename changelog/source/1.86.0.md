# 1.86.0

<details>
  <summary>Update EKS basic components @Nuru (#509)</summary>

### what && why

Update EKS cluster and basic Kubernetes components for better behavior on initial deployment and on `terraform destroy`.

- Update minimum Terraform version to 1.1.0 and use `one()` where applicable to manage resources that can be disabled with `count = 0` and for bug fixes regarding destroy behavior
- Update `terraform-aws-eks-cluster` to v2.5.0 for better destroy behavior
- Update all components'  (plus `account-map/modules/`)`remote-state` to v1.2.0 for better destroy behavior
- Update all components' `helm-release` to v0.7.0 and move namespace creation via Kubernetes provider into it to avoid race conditions regarding creating IAM roles, Namespaces, and deployments, and to delete namespaces when destroyed
- Update `alb-controller` to deploy a default IngressClass for central, obvious configuration of shared default ingress for services that do not have special needs. 
- Add `alb-controller-ingress-class` for the rare case when we want to deploy a non-default IngressClass outside of the component that will be using it
- Update `echo-server` to use the default IngressClass and not specify any configuration that affects other Ingresses, and remove dependence on `alb-controller-ingress-group` (which should be deprecated in favor of `alb-controller-ingress-class` and perhaps a specialized future `alb-controller-ingress`)
- Update `cert-manager` to remove `default.auto.tfvars` (which had a lot of settings) and add dependencies so that initial deployment succeeds in one `terraform apply` and destroy works in one `terraform destroy`
- Update `external-dns` to remove `default.auto.tfvars` (which had a lot of settings)
- Update `karpenter` to v0.18.0, fix/update IAM policy (README still needs work, but leaving that for another day)
- Update `karpenter-provisioner` to require Terraform 1.3 and make elements of the Provisioner configuration optional. Support block device mappings (previously broken). Avoid perpetual Terraform plan diff/drift caused by setting fields to `null`.
- Update `reloader`
- Update `mixins/provider-helm` to better support `terraform destroy` and to default the Kubernetes client authentication API version to `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1`
