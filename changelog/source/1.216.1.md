# 1.216.1

### ðŸš€ Enhancements

<details>
  <summary>Preserve custom roles when vendoring in updates @Nuru (#697)</summary>

### what

- Add `additional-policy-map.tf` as glue meant to be replaced by customers with map of their custom policies.

### why

- Currently, custom polices have to be manually added to the map in `main.tf`, but that gets overwritten with every vendor update. Putting that map in a separate, optional file allows for the custom code to survive vendoring.
