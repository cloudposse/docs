# 1.182.1

### ðŸš€ Enhancements

<details>
  <summary>[aws-config] Update usage info, add "help" and "teams" commands @Nuru (#647)</summary>

### what

Update `aws-config` command:
- Add `teams` command and suggest "aws-config-teams" file name instead of "aws-config-saml" because we want to use "aws-config-teams" for both SAML and SSO logins with Leapp handling the difference.
- Add `help` command
- Add more extensive help
- Do not rely on script generated by `account-map` for command `main()` function

### why
- Reflect latest design pattern
- Improved user experience
