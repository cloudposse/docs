# 1.135.0

<details>
  <summary>github-runners add support for runner groups @johncblandii (#569)</summary>

### what
* Added optional support for separating runners by groups

NOTE: I don't know if the default of `default` is valid or if it is `Default`. I'll confirm this soon.

### why
* Groups are supported by GitHub and allow for Actions to target specific runners by group vs by label

### references

* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups
