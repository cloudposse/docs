# 1.177.0

<details>
  <summary>Convert eks/cluster to aws-teams and aws-sso @Nuru (#645)</summary>

### what

- Convert `eks/cluster` to `aws-teams` 
- Add `aws-sso` support to `eks/cluster`
- Undo automatic allowance of `identity` `aws-sso` permission sets into account roles added in #567 

### why

- Keep in sync with other modules
- #567 is a silent privilege escalation and not needed to accomplish desired goals
