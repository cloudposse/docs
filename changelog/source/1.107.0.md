# 1.107.0

<details>
  <summary>Update pod security context schema in cert-manager @max-lobur (#538)</summary>

### what
Pod security context `enabled` field has been deprecated. Now you just specify the options and that's it.
Update the options per recent schema. See references

Tested on k8s 1.24

### why
* Otherwise it does not pass Deployment validation on newer clusters.
