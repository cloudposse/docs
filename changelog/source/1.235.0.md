# 1.235.0

<details>
  <summary>[account-map]  Backwards compatibility for terraform profile users and eks/cluster  @Nuru (#731)</summary>

### what

- [account-map/modules/iam-roles] Add `profiles_enabled` input to override global value
- [eks/cluster] Use `iam-roles` `profiles_enabled` input to force getting a role ARN even when profiles are in use
- [guardduty] Make providers compatible with static and dynamic TF roles

### why

- Previously, when the global `account-map` `profiles_enabled` flag was `true`, `iam_roles.terraform_role_arn` would be null. However, `eks/cluster` requires `terraform_role_arn` regardless.
- Changes made in #728 work in environments that have not adopted dynamic Terraform roles but would fail in environments that have (when using SuperAdmin)
