# 1.242.0

<details>
  <summary>Restore backwards compatibility of account-map output @Nuru (#748)</summary>

### what

- Restore backwards compatibility of `account-map` output

### why

- PR #715 removed outputs from `account-map` that `iam-roles` relied on. Although it removed the references in `iam-roles`, this imposed an ordering on the upgrade: the `iam-roles` code had to be deployed before the module could be applied. That proved to be inconvenient. Furthermore, if a future `account-map` upgrade added outputs that iam-roles` required, neither order of operations would go smoothly. With this update, the standard practice of applying `account-map` before deploying code will work again.
