<details>
  <summary>Aurora Resource Submodule Requirements @milldr (#775)</summary>

### what
- Removed unnecessary requirement for aurora resources for the service name not to equal the user name for submodules of both aurora resource components

### why
- This conditional doesn't add any value besides creating an unnecessary restriction. We should be able to create a user name as the service name if we want

### references
- n/a
